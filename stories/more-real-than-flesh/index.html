<h1 class="has-subtitle" id="more-real-than-flesh">More Real Than
Flesh</h1>
<p>by <a href="https://gbmj.net/">Grayson Bray Morris</a></p>
<p>The day’s first customer walked through Petch’s door. He was slender,
not ugly, reasonably clean-cut: better than she was used to. But the
glint in his eyes was pure sadist. He would want pain, and blood, and
probably death.</p>
<p>They all wanted those things. What was it in this one that frightened
her?</p>
<p>The john was already sitting down across from her. Petch smiled at
him, a little lopsided to highlight that she was flesh. Up close, the
johns could see the lines creasing the corners of her eyes; her tight
dresslet played up the imperfection of her tits. Karson had cupped his
hands around those tits the day she showed up looking for work, fifteen
and lost and really, really hungry, and said, “Left one’s half again
bigger than the right. Sweet jesus, they’ll pay double for you.”</p>
<p>The john let his unaugmented gaze travel from her eyes down to her
exposed crotch, like they all did. When she figured he was halfway
through gaping, Petch fidgeted a little; fidgeting was so hard for a
sexbot to get right. The john watched her fingers move on the arm of the
chair, watched her left knee bump into her right as she shifted her
weight. She was the real deal.</p>
<p>He looked back up into her eyes, lingering a fraction of a second on
her mouth, and Petch realized what scared her about him: he knew how to
kill her. Really kill her, for good.</p>
<p>Petch gave herself ten seconds to feel the weight of her life
pressing down. Why couldn’t she have a sweet one, just once? There were
plenty of decent johns looking for connection in a world where touch was
a second-class sense, hungry to fumble through awkward sex instead of
getting digital feedback-loop ecstasy with somebody’s perfect avatar. A
john who wanted to walk in, short and fat with mousy brown hair or tall
and skinny and balding, and have a short, fat mousy girl with uneven
tits take him by the hand and fuck him. Really fuck him, not just send a
packet of bits over the net and stimulate his neural feed.</p>
<p>But Karson didn’t traffic in those johns. He catered to the ones who
wanted to slice thin lines into a girl’s skin, to squeeze her throat and
feel it spasm beneath their hands. Who wanted to punish her for being
born to imperfect flesh. Petch had perfected the art of dropping herself
at just the right time, slumping into lifelessness so naturally no john
had ever suspected he didn’t kill her himself. And, conveniently,
notifying tech that end game had been reached so they could get her out
of there in time.</p>
<p>But this one knew. And he’d gotten past Karson.</p>
<p>Petch smiled at the john as she slid her lower jaw forward. His eyes
widened and he lunged for her, but she bit down hard, sliding her right
upper canine into the lower first molar and making contact. She felt his
hands grab her mouth, but he was too late. She was gone, and Karson’s
boys would be there in seconds, before he had time to cut her up while
her blood was still warm.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Out in the real world,</span> Petch was
beautiful. Her avatar was tall and thin, with an hourglass waist and
perfect tits. As soon as she left the shielding in Karson’s compound,
the net read out her stream, her optical feed kicked in, and she was a
normal girl in the normal world.</p>
<p>Not that Karson let her out much. Two or three times a week, he’d let
a couple of the girls go into town with some of his tech boys.
Chaperones, Karson said, to make sure nobody gave his girls any
trouble.</p>
<p>They made it damned hard to find the keymaker.</p>
<p>Petch hadn’t always known about the keymaker. The first time she
bolted, climbing out the bathroom window at a club, she woke up
disoriented, staring at Karson’s amused face. She hadn’t known he could
drop her from a distance; she thought maybe she’d fainted, and the tech
boy had brought her back in. “Little girl, you can’t ever get away from
me,” Karson had grinned at her. “I hold the keys to your soul.” She’d
thought he was being poetic.</p>
<p>But the third time, when the whole damned misery of being so
thoroughly owned kept her from opening her eyes right away after they’d
shunted her back to life, she heard Karson say, “Tell the keymaker to
reconfigure her lockdown to twenty yards. She damn near made it into the
street, and the wetware ain’t worth jack if she gets her body run
over.”</p>
<p>She’d thought he meant the expensive, illegal, military-grade backup
chips he’d put in her head would be damaged, and he’d lose her. Later,
she realized the soul whose keys he held was worthless to him, just
necessary software pulling the strings of her lucrative flesh.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Karson let her take</span> one of the tech
boys into town to watch the latest immersive vid. Beforehand, drinking
lattes in the square as they watched a particularly talented morph
artist run through his show, the tech boy said, “Keymaker’s not far from
here.”</p>
<p>Petch nearly dropped her coffee. She pulled the tech boy’s feed into
focus, but he was still watching the morph artist like he hadn’t
spoken.</p>
<p>It was a test. If Karson found out she knew about the keymaker again,
he’d wipe her, and she’d have to start all over. Motherfucker never
wiped any of her working memories; he left every miserable death bright
in her mind, taking only the little things that made her life bearable.
Like knowing there was a keymaker.</p>
<p>The worst part always came right after she found out again, after the
bright searing hope sliced up through her and made tears sting her eyes.
When the knowledge tapped inactive wetbits into resonance, like deja vu,
and she realized she’d known this before, and before again, going back
for years, and every time, Karson had taken it from her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you to him.”</p>
<p><em>Not very subtle, Karson. You got to pick them better than that if
you want me to fall for it.</em> “Who? Some new john? Karson tell you to
make me work before the show?” It didn’t matter, Petch realized. Karson
was going to wipe her whether she feigned innocence or not. “Ah, shit,”
she said, throwing her latte to the ground. The rolling cup briefly
intruded on the feeds of several nearby patrons before the café software
filtered it out of its stream.</p>
<p>“This is the day you’ve been waiting for, Petch.” The tech boy’s
avatar still watched the show with smiling interest, but he’d unlocked
his stream for her. She switched him to camera input and looked at the
thin, pockmarked young man across the table. He wasn’t bored, wasn’t
fidgeting, none of the usual tells. He was just watching her eyes.</p>
<p>Petch stared at him silently. “Why do you care?” she said at
last.</p>
<p>The tech boy smiled at her before he looked away. “Because you pay me
to.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">The next ten minutes</span> were a series of
wetbit cascades, the tech boy accessing her forgotten memories until
Petch thought she’d go mad.</p>
<p>“Karson pays for the Class II wetware, then skimps on the wipes,” the
tech boy said. “He should pay for full erase capability instead of just
unlinking the memories in the personal module.” He leaned forward.
“Look, Petch, I’ve caught you up to speed, and now we’ve got to get
moving if we’re going to be done before Karson decides we’ve been gone
too long and drops you.”</p>
<p>“Will he drop you, too?” Petch asked.</p>
<p>The tech boy shook his head. “Karson buys tech loyalty the
old-fashioned way, with free snatch and plenty of bling. No extra chips
in our heads.” He tapped behind one ear. “No restart if we disappoint
him, either. So let’s get going, okay?”</p>
<p>Petch stopped cold. “I can’t be paying you enough to take that kind
of gamble.”</p>
<p>He just smiled at her.</p>
<p>“You’ve been helping me for a long time,” she said, realizing.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember you. Not much.” She had only sketchy memories of
the tech boy, coming in to revive her after a john had gone, behind a
desk in Karson’s office when she came in for a bitcheck.</p>
<p>He shrugged and looked away. “Sometimes bits get lost.”</p>
<p><em>Sometimes bits get lost.</em> Friendship gets lost, just like
that. Petch had custom wetware in her head that nobody had access to,
top of the line state of the art sexbot-and-soldier fucking wetware, and
sometimes bits got lost.</p>
<p>“Do I forget you every time he wipes me?” she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head, still looking out across the square. “Just this
time. Just a shitty fluke of the bits.”</p>
<p>But he hadn’t seemed surprised. Hadn’t asked her if she remembered
him now, after the cascade.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe every single personal memory she had of him
was lost. Maybe she hadn’t had any. Maybe he was just a puppy in love
from afar, a soft heart crying over a broken, damaged flesh whore.</p>
<p>He was still open to her, still in the flesh, but she’d kept her
stream locked to him. She had to; she needed every second she could get
out here, in public, where privacy law meant people only saw her in the
flesh if <em>she</em> let them. But memories or no, he was risking his
life for her.</p>
<p>“Kirit,” she said. The least she could do was call him by name. He
turned back to her, a question on his face, and maybe a little hope.</p>
<p>Petch took a deep breath and made her avatar reflect the
embarrassment she felt. “I’m sorry, I can’t unlock my stream for you.”
She looked straight into his eyes. They were bright blue, so vivid it
was amazing they were his flesh eyes; for a moment they made him
beautiful, and almost familiar.</p>
<p>Kirit nodded. He stared at her with his vivid, too-large eyes, and
she watched them trace a line down her face, over her shoulder, as if he
were brushing back a lock of her hair. Her flesh hair, long because
Karson said it had to be. She kept it short in the real world.</p>
<p>“I see what’s underneath every day, Petch,” he finally said. “I also
see what’s inside.” He tapped his head. “Karson’s never even bothered to
look.” He relocked his stream, and his blond, gym-rat avatar replaced
the skinny boy in Petch’s feed. “That’s why he’ll never know you’re
gone.”</p>
<p>Petch’s heart raced. “Today is different,” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Today we switch you out.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Petch’s hidden account,</span> to which
she’d apparently been siphoning credits in invisible tens and twenties
from her pay and from the shopping money Karson gave her for her trips
to town, had reached eighty thousand last night. Sixteen years of
saving, at first just because it made her feel she had some kind of
control, later because she was planning her escape.</p>
<p>Petch didn’t remember being so close to goal, even after Kirit told
her. He just shrugged and looked away. “Sometimes bits get lost,” he
said again.</p>
<p>She had enough to buy a Class II sexbot, the kind sold as wives to
rich old men, with modules that made conversation and emulated feelings,
with bodies that were hard to tell from flesh; and, after that, she
still had enough to pay the keymaker.</p>
<p>Kirit transferred payment to the café bill feed and bought two vid
tickets they wouldn’t use. Two minutes after they left the café square,
he turned into an alley that didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Somebody had a lot of savvy, locking out the public camera stream
like that. No seams where the generated bricks met the ordinary ones, no
feed hiccups between the streams.</p>
<p>Kirit’s leg stuck back through the hacked-in wall, into the range of
the cameras. The leg in Petch’s feed was pale above scuffed sneakers;
Kirit had turned his stream completely off. He leaned forward and stuck
his face through. “Petch,” he said softly. “I know it’s hard, but you’re
going to have to turn off your stream here.”</p>
<p>Petch balked, and he smiled at her. “It’s okay. I still know who you
really are.”</p>
<p>“But they don’t,” she said, gesturing. “I want them to see the real
me, only the real me, not that.”</p>
<p>“Petch, the keymaker has to drop you anyway to make the switch. And
the rest aren’t going to see you at all. All they’ll see is a big, fat
stream of credits coming in, and believe me, they’ll think you’re
beautiful.”</p>
<p>She hesitated ten seconds, then twenty, until the fear took hold,
that Karson might drop her and wipe her and make her wait another month,
another year. Another second.</p>
<p>That he might drop Kirit for good, really kill him, because of
her.</p>
<p>He had been a friend to her, the pockmarked boy with the bright blue
eyes. But that wasn’t really him; the real Kirit, the one he’d created,
was smooth, blond, tanned and muscled. Now that she’d seen his avatar,
it was rude of her to think of him as anything else, as the accidental
flesh he’d been born into.</p>
<p>Yet she was glad he’d kept his avatar eyes the same, beautiful
blue.</p>
<p>Petch switched off her stream and took Kirit’s outstretched hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">“You’ll miss it at first,”</span> the
keymaker told her. “Your old body. But soon enough you’ll get used to
the new one.”</p>
<p>Petch watched the sexbot wetware in her old body wake up on the
platform beside her, watched the keymaker check its vitals. Her old body
looked around the room, taking in Petch, the keymaker, Kirit.</p>
<p>Kirit was watching Petch.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to take her back,” he said. “Before Karson drops her.”</p>
<p>Petch’s new belly soared like a roller coaster. No one would ever
drop her again. Kirit smiled at her, but his eyes were somber.</p>
<p>“Does she think she’s me?” Petch asked. “Will she pass?” What she
meant was, <em>are you going to survive this?</em></p>
<p>“I copied in your memories of the work, your name, your personal
details,” the keymaker said. “As long as no one questions her too
closely, she’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“Can she fidget?” Petch asked. If the johns complained, Kirit would
die.</p>
<p>The short, fat sexbot with uneven tits bumped her knees together in
answer, tapping her fingers on the platform padding, wiggling her toes,
smiling Petch’s lopsided smile.</p>
<p>“Karson will never suspect,” Kirit said. “But I’ll miss you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you, too,” Petch said. And though it felt like she’d only
met him today, she knew she would. But the keymaker was wrong; she
wouldn’t miss her old body at all. It had never been
real; <em>this</em> body, now, this body was real. Tall, thin, with an
hourglass waist and perfect tits.</p>
<p>But Kirit just kept staring at her eyes.</p>
