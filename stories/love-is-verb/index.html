<h1 class="has-subtitle" id="love-is-a-verb">Love Is a Verb</h1>
<p>by <a href="https://gbmj.net/">Grayson Bray Morris</a></p>
<p>A soft mewing pierces the low hum of the hospital room, instantly
rousing Kate. She presses the call button before she’s even opened her
eyes, then peels herself off the vinyl recliner and slides into the
narrow bed beside her twelve-year-old daughter. As a nurse runs morphine
into Robin’s IV, Kate runs light fingers over her daughter’s back, in
the slow pattern she instinctively knows Robin likes. She’s always had
that gift, some kind of sympathetic resonance with other people’s
bodies; all she has to do is close her eyes and she can feel where the
muscles are tight, where the tissue is tender, her fingers drawn to the
places that need them by some force not under her conscious control.</p>
<p>The morphine kicks in and Robin’s breathing falls into the soft
pattern that means the pain’s dulled enough to let her sleep. Kate stays
beside her, the cramp in her side from her contorted position a minor
datum. She breathes deep, savoring the scent of her daughter’s skin. She
knows it will fade from memory as the years pass, but right now it’s
still here, still hers, for however much longer they have.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">An hour later</span> one of the fearless
young nurses who brave Pediatric Oncology sticks her head in the door.
“Sleeping?” she mouths, pointing at Robin. Kate nods and eases off the
bed to follow her.</p>
<p>In the hall the nurse hands Kate a neatly folded sock. “Found it! I
dug through the laundry before they took it away.”</p>
<p>Kate’s eyes well up. “Oh, god, you didn’t have to do that. We could
have lived without it.”</p>
<p>“I know.” The nurse smiles and rubs Kate’s arm. “Have you eaten
anything since lunch?” Kate shakes her head, and the nurse says, “Hold
that thought.” She comes back ten minutes later with a heaping plate of
tacos, black beans, and guacamole. “Meals That Heal is up on Ped Pulm
tonight,” she grins as she hands Kate the plate.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought"><em>However much longer</em></span> turns
out to be unbearably short. But then, it always would have.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Seconds become hours</span> become weeks
become years; and life, inexplicably, carries on.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Kate’s brushing her teeth</span> before bed
when her phone blares out John Denver’s “Country Roads”: her sister
Eva’s ringtone. Eva never calls this late; it’s past midnight where she
lives.</p>
<p>Jack’s dead. Her husband Jack is dead. He was only thirty-seven. Kate
listens as her shell-shocked sister runs through each detail again, and
again, and again.</p>
<p>They were on the couch, watching TV. Eva turned to Jack to snark
about the show and he was staring straight ahead, unbreathing, veins
bulging in his rigid neck. 911 talked her through CPR. When the
ambulance arrived the techs ushered her outside, as if she hadn’t
already seen the horror. At the hospital she watched through glass as
seven people labored over his failing body, then watched as they all
fell still. Time stopped then, balanced for one brief instant on the
keen tip of a pin too small for angels to see, before its unstoppable
fall from grace.</p>
<p>Not that Eva describes it that way. But Kate knows what the moment is
like.</p>
<p>She listens for an hour, until Eva asks her how fast she can be
there. Then she packs a bag and begins the long eastward drive to
Michigan.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Just before dawn</span> she stops at an
all-night Texaco outside Moline, Illinois for a Snickers and more
Kleenex. As she’s paying she hears two teens down the aisle behind her
counting their money. They come up a dollar thirty-five short. God knows
what they’re buying at this hour. It doesn’t matter. Kate puts six
quarters on the counter. “For them,” she says, catching the clerk’s eye
before she leaves.</p>
<p><em>He didn’t make a sound</em>, Eva kept saying on the phone.
<em>Why didn’t he make any noise? I would have looked over sooner if
he’d just… But he never made a sound</em>. Kate knows what that’s like,
too. If only you’d seen the signs right away. It’s a long road to
letting that one go, paved with heartsickness sharper than diamond.</p>
<p>She tosses the Snickers and Kleenex onto the passenger seat and
sticks her key in the ignition. As she starts the car the two kids walk
out of the Texaco, armed with a giant bag of Doritos and two
sixteen-ounce Cokes. Kate silently wishes them well and pulls out onto
I-80 East, toward the rising sun and her grieving baby sister.</p>
