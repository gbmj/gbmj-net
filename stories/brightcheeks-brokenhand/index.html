<h1 id="brightcheeks-and-brokenhand">Brightcheeks and Brokenhand</h1>
<p>by <a href="https://gbmj.net/">Grayson Bray Morris</a></p>
<p>Someone was creaking none too quietly down the stairs to my basement
workshop. I turned to deliver my tenth fatherly lecture to the butcher’s
boy about jimmying the lock on a person’s front door and promptly
dropped the flask of stinkwort oil I’d been holding.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the butcher’s boy.</p>
<p>My unannounced visitor was covered head to toe in armor: not the
sparkly kind the king’s guard wear, but thick, dull stuff, dented and
stained, and covered with trigger-clasp niches for the poisoned knives
of her trade. Oh, my: a member of the slayers’ league, a renegade band
only slightly less terrifying than the dragons they hunted. If she
hadn’t pushed back her visor before she spoke, revealing an ordinary
young face not so different from the ones I labored over every fourteen
days, I might have fainted on the spot.</p>
<p>I squeezed all the respectful confidence I could muster into my own
rather young voice. “You’ll be wanting the armorer. Two streets over.
Here, I’ll draw you a map.”</p>
<p>She clanked into my workshop with an ominous rattle. “No, I won’t.
I’m where I mean to be.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“You’re the virgician, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I was: that unlucky soul tasked with preparing tender, trembling
virgins for their date with death-by-dragon. It was a horrible job, but
it came with a home and a comfortable stipend. Not to mention the
opportunity to carry on the happy task of living, rather than being
executed for failing to perform my appointed duty. “Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Then I’m set. Look, I’ve got all the armor I could possibly wear. It
won’t keep me from getting my limbs clawed off, then spurting blood
until I’m too weak to move, then being charred to an oily cinder and
feeling dragon fangs sink into me just before I die.”</p>
<p>I felt my lunch poke an inquisitive finger toward my throat (no doubt
aided by the waft of stinkwort rising from the puddle by my feet).</p>
<p>“No,” the slayer went on with a thoughtful look, “I need a clever
strategy, something new. I need a disguise to put me near them while
they sleep.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” I said, beset by sudden understanding. “Oh, no. You want
<em>me</em> to prepare <em>you</em> for <em>sacrifice</em>?” She nodded,
and my lunch promptly sank into my legs. “Well, the thing is, miss—that
is, sir—”</p>
<p>“Brightcheeks.” She narrowed her eyes, but I didn’t need a warning;
silly name or no, I wasn’t about to laugh at a dragonslayer.</p>
<p>“Yes. Well. Sir Brightcheeks. You are no doubt aware the treaty
stipulates virgins with unblemished cream-white skin, hair of faintest
gold, eyes of palest gray, and a voice sweeter than honey.” You see why
my profession arose: how many of those could a village have?</p>
<p>“Of course.” She arched an eyebrow, as if I’d said water was wet and
the sky was blue.</p>
<p>Heavens help me, I was going to have to spell it out. “Well, you see,
sir,” I said with all the please-don’t-kill-me regret I could pour into
my voice, “here’s the thing. I can glamor a girl into flaxen hair and
pale skin and a pretty voice, that’s all surface stuff.” I took a deep
breath. “But there’s no way to turn a—” I cleared my throat “—an, ah—” I
coughed “—a, shall we say, <em>mature</em> woman back into an
<em>immature</em> maiden.” I shut my eyes, waiting for her to vent her
displeasure at this inconvenient fact.</p>
<p>After several pain-free seconds in which the only sound was my
galloping heart, I opened one eye. The slayer was still watching me, her
hands no closer to a dagger than before.</p>
<p>“I understand it’s a challenge,” she said at last, taking a step
forward. “But it can be done.”</p>
<p>I took a step backward. “Sir, despite my youth, I am well-versed in
the teachings of my trade. I know of no spell that can do what you
ask.”</p>
<p>“Then invent one,” she said, in a tone that left no room for
alternatives. “I’ll be back in the morning.” With that, the slayer
banged a hand against her dented breastplate and blew out of my little
workshop. A moment later I heard my front door slam behind her.</p>
<p>I blinked. Then I smacked my lips and turned left and right with no
discernible purpose. At last I fixed upon a plan of action and shuffled
to the rack of smocks hanging beside my overstuffed bookcase, where I
pulled a thin flask of Tralkish brandywine from a pocket in the middle
of the jumble. There was really only one way to prepare for the
dragonslayer’s return tomorrow, and I went to it.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">“Morning, virgician,” the dragonslayer
boomed</span> as she rattled into my workshop. In that she was correct:
sunlight thrust its irritating way down the stairs from my living
quarters and through the open door. I mumbled something incoherent and
rubbed my pasty eyes. I hadn’t even made it to my bed last night; I’d
spent it on the cold, potion-spattered stone floor of my workshop, and
felt exactly as one would imagine I’d feel.</p>
<p>The dragonslayer laughed at me and held out a metal-clad hand. I
stared at it dumbly.</p>
<p>“Well go on, take it!” she said, clanking her fingers together. I
closed my eyes and took it, expecting my arm to be yanked out of its
socket, but her grip was surprisingly gentle. She led me to the
ramshackle couch where, every fortnight, I served cookies and saxonberry
tea to the distraught mother and terrified daughter <em>du jour</em>.
Once the slayer had me seated, she backed away and appraised me. “Looks
like you’ve had quite a night.”</p>
<p>I nodded, to my immediate regret.</p>
<p>“I presume your drinking didn’t interfere with your work?” She opened
the basket she had brought in with her, and I smelled the usually
delectable but currently debatable aroma of the baker’s sweetgum
buns.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “About that—”</p>
<p>“We don’t have long, virgician. In three weeks the league will call
me back and send me to fight the ordinary way.”</p>
<p>I sucked in a sharp breath; she might as well have said <em>in three
weeks, I’ll be raking myself to shreds with a pitchfork, then throwing
myself into a raging fire</em>. Most slayers never even wounded their
dragons. Which was probably why the king made only half-hearted attempts
to round them up; it was more efficient to let them destroy
themselves.</p>
<p>“I intend for us to kill your town’s little dragon before then, and
several larger ones as well.”</p>
<p>This was the first time anyone had implied that Smantsley’s dragon
was less than gigantic, and I shuddered to think other towns had bigger
ones—and that the slayer meant to drag me along to meet them. “Now,
wait,” I said, panic rising. “Just hold on a minute.”</p>
<p>“If we strike fast enough, we can kill all ninety-seven before the
king has time to capture us. I’ve worked it all out.” Her eyes were
bright and fierce. “There’s no other way to kill them. So you have to
find a way to restore my maidenhead, virgician.”</p>
<p>All ninety-seven? The panic reached my brain, and I snapped. “Stop
calling me that. I hate that word. My name’s Dinsday Rapsson. Friends—”
such as I had them, given my profession “—call me Din.”</p>
<p>I expected her to roar on about my role as an involuntary cog in her
dragon-killing wheels, quite possibly after cuffing me bloody with her
studded metal fists for emphasis, but she just said, “All right,
Din.”</p>
<p>Her response struck me dumb—but only momentarily. “What about you?” I
demanded, panic making me testy. “Don’t you have some other name? The
one you gave me yesterday can’t possibly be the one your mother gave
you.”</p>
<p>Her fiery expression twisted and I found myself looking at a haunted
young face. “Callamynta,” she said. “My friends called me Cal.”</p>
<p><em>My friends called me Cal.</em> Words cupped around a sea of
heartbreak. In an instant, my panic burned away and I saw the young girl
conscripted years ago from her village by a band of outlaws. This young
warrior standing in my workshop had probably never wanted to fight
dragons at all, and here she was, devising a plan that could free the
entire kingdom. And her plan truly was a clever one, aside from that one
impossible detail.</p>
<p>“Callamynta,” I said. “It’s a lovely name. I’ll be honored to call
you Cal.”</p>
<p>She smiled. I smiled back. And just like that, Cal and I were a
team.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">“Let’s start with my hair,”</span> Cal said
after we had broken our fast on the sweetgum buns and a pot of very
strong bitterroot tea.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” I shrugged. Lightening a girl’s hair was normally the
last step of the preparatory process, being an immediate plant-based
remedy that could hardly go wrong, but nothing about this was business
as usual. I looked at her expectantly, but she didn’t move. “Ah, Cal,
you’ll be needing to take off your helmet.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes. “Why?”</p>
<p>I blinked at her. <em>Why?</em> “Because your hair is underneath
it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.” She began removing the armor protecting her head and
neck and I cast my professional eye across her scalp. “Oh, lovely. Much
healthier than I’d have expected with, ah, the dragonslaying lifestyle.
And those curls! Chestnut, grade two, with grade-one highlights shading
into auburn. Piece of cake.” I reached out to touch a strand and
suddenly found myself pinned to the floor and gasping, with a hard metal
knee in my back and one arm twisted painfully behind me.</p>
<p>“Cal,” I grunted against the floor, “is there something about you I’m
missing? Some dragonslayer rule about touching people’s hair?”</p>
<p>She released me. “Sorry. Reflex.”</p>
<p>I lumbered to my feet and massaged my lower back. “If there are any
other slayer no-nos I should know about, do tell. I’m all ears.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s okay. I just thought you were—” She shook her head. “It’s
okay.”</p>
<p>“All righty, then.” I gave my back one last knead and pointed at the
processing chair by the washbasin. “Have a seat and we’ll get started.”
I plucked three vials from the shelf and started my standard spiel.
“Alchemist’s clearbane, to strip all color from your hair. Goldenroot,
to shade it flaxen. And oil of mackwort, to make it shine. Soon you’ll
be as fair-haired as I am.” I walked around the chair. “First, I’ll wet
your hair. Don’t be alarmed; the chair back will lower now, so the water
doesn’t drip onto your clothing. Ah, armor.” I released the pin holding
the chair back upright; but I didn’t account for the added weight of
Cal’s armor, and instead of gently lowering into position with my hand
to guide it, the slatted frame plunged toward the underlying table,
pinning my hand between the wood and the lip of the ceramic basin.
“Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Cal instantly sat up and I pulled my poor hand away and cradled it,
hopping around the room like a rabid frog.</p>
<p>“Let me see it,” she said. I hopped over to her and she pried away
the fingers of my other hand to get a look. I moaned when I saw the
swelling. Then she pushed on one finger, and I screamed.</p>
<p>“Broken,” she pronounced.</p>
<p>“Great!” I shouted. “Just <em>great!</em> We don’t…
Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“That one, too.”</p>
<p>I snatched my hand back and cradled it to my chest. Cal stood up and
replaced her head and neck armor. “What are you doing?” I whined.</p>
<p>“Taking you to the bonesetter. Where’s your key?”</p>
<p>I pointed at the lower left-hand pocket of the smock I was wearing,
and Cal pulled out my keyring.</p>
<p>“<em>Eight</em> keys?”</p>
<p>“I’m the virgician,” I wheezed. “The town really, really,
<em>really</em> doesn’t want anyone getting in here.” All it took was
one grief-crazed parent with a torch—or even just a sack and a broom—and
the village would have no perfect virgin to offer the dragon. We’d be
set back fifty years, before the treaty, when dragons roamed the kingdom
at will, scorching entire towns to cinder.</p>
<p>Cal swung the heavy metal workshop door shut and secured all seven
locks as I moaned beside her. I followed her upstairs, through the
shocking disarray of my home—now that I was seeing it through visitor’s
eyes—and out onto the street, where she secured the final, ordinary lock
on my front door, this time with its key.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” I said, as something I’d seen in the house finally
registered. “Were those <em>your</em> things in the living room?”</p>
<p>Cal nodded.</p>
<p>“You slept in <em>my</em> house last night?” I was speechless, for
approximately half a second. “I don’t believe this! You break into my
home, you waltz uninvited into my private workshop—a place no one ever
wants to enter, I might add—”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> wanted to enter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but—” And then my outrage vanished.</p>
<p>People didn’t hate me; I was a likeable enough fellow, and I dare say
many of them felt sorry for me. But they lost their appetite when I came
to sate mine in the tavern. They discovered a sudden need for something
from the nearest shop when I was on the street, and a pressing urgency
to be on the street when I entered a shop. But the hardest thing was the
way mothers unconsciously gasped and shielded their daughters when they
saw me, as if <em>I</em> were the dragon who would kill them. If only
they knew how ironic that was: my childhood had been one long exercise
in conflict avoidance. I’d been a timid boy, small and bookish, and only
the bullies had taken an interest in me. The hope I’d clung to of
finally making friends once I entered the civilized world of adults was
permanently obliterated when the virgician’s guild commandeered me.</p>
<p>So Cal had broken in, so she’d barged into my workshop, so she’d
slept in my house without asking: she was also the only person ever, in
my miserable life, to willingly seek my company.</p>
<p>“There’s a spare bed in the back room,” I said. “We just need to find
it under all the clutter.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">The bonesetter splinted together</span> the
fingers on my right hand, rendering it useless for much of anything. I
supposed I should be happy he managed even that, trembling as he was
with a dragonslayer looking on.</p>
<p>The bandaging was very large and very white and my hand looked very
like a misshapen rabbit’s ear. “How long?” I asked testily.</p>
<p>The bonesetter pursed his lips. “Month and a half, give or take. Come
back in a month and I’ll check your progress.”</p>
<p>“Month and a half?” I turned an outraged face to Cal. “I can’t have a
broken hand for a month and a half!”</p>
<p>“But you do,” she said. “Come on. We’ll eat, and then we’ll do what
we can do with three unbroken hands.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Three unbroken hands</span> were enough for
us to get the back room in presentable shape by lunchtime, and I spent
the rest of the day with my nose deep in spellbooks I hadn’t opened in
years. As I’d expected, I came up empty. In a final, what’s-to-lose
effort, I hunted down my dusty copy of <em>Carsgrynd’s Spells to Inspyre
Awe and Terror</em>. It was worth a try: Carsgrynd, whose works tended
to the sensational (and a fetish for muslin), was reviled among
professional alchemists, but unlike those of most dabblers, his spells
had a reputation for working.</p>
<p>It was a book that had kept me company on many a childhood night. How
to Lyft a Standyng Stone. How to Eat One’s Weyght in Horsemeat. How to
Turn Innocent Objects into Instruments of Terror. I’d read that last one
a thousand times, imagining the looks on my tormentors’ faces as I
deftly sliced the air with a sword that moments before had been a long
stick. Of course, I’d never had the courage to actually try it.</p>
<p>After a bittersweet stroll down memory lane, I closed the book with a
sigh. There were no virginity spells here, either. I’d have to look
beyond my own—considerable—collection of spellbooks.</p>
<p>As I slid Carsgrynd back into the bookcase, something caught my eye.
It was the corner of a book that had apparently fallen behind the
others, but I instantly remembered what had really happened. The book
was <em>Carsgrynd’s Secret Guyde to the Intymate Arts</em>, a beet-eared
purchase in my teenage days. Despite its purely academic relevance to my
life, I’d never quite managed to part with it. So I’d hidden it in the
immense chaos that was my bookcase, where no one would find it, and
promptly forgotten it existed. Until now.</p>
<p>And there it was, on page seventy-three: How to Restore Maydenhead
and Avoyd Parental Dyspleasure.</p>
<p>“Cal!” I yelled triumphantly. “I found it! I really found it!”</p>
<p>I just hoped I wouldn’t lose a kidney when I told her she’d have to
take off her armor for the spell.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">“Did it work?”</span> Cal’s keenly hopeful
eyes stared at me from beneath the mountain of muslin draped around her
head.</p>
<p>I sighed and lowered the keparine. “No.”</p>
<p>“No?” She took the crystal from me. “That can’t be. The crystal must
be broken. Or you used it incorrectly.”</p>
<p>Her look of disbelief made my blood boil. “I most certainly did
not.”</p>
<p>“Go buy a new one, and we’ll try it again.”</p>
<p>“Go buy—?” I threw up my hands. “Do you have any idea how expensive a
keparine of this size is? Go buy a new one, she says.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you stored it improperly, or—”</p>
<p>“There is nothing wrong with my keparine!” I shouted. “Here, look!” I
swung the crystal around my body in Carsgrynd’s pattern, and it began to
glow a soft green. “See? If the spell had worked, it would have turned
green for you, too.”</p>
<p>Cal stared at me like I was some kind of rare animal she’d only read
about in books.</p>
<p>“<em>What?</em>” I snapped.</p>
<p>“You’re a virgin,” she said. “You’ve never…”</p>
<p>“That’s right! I’ve <em>never</em>. Unlike some people, I’ve been
saving myself for a special, sacred moment with a—”</p>
<p>Her bare fist knocked me backward. Even without her armor, it hurt
like the devil. Before I could say a word, she had a hand around my
throat. “Don’t you talk to me like that,” she growled. “You don’t know
anything about me.” She let me go and I raised an indignant hand to my
throbbing neck.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been bullied like that in years. And this time by a
<em>friend</em>. My sense of betrayal had me simultaneously outraged and
on the verge of tears. How <em>dare</em> she?</p>
<p>“Well, I know you picked a really stupid name,” I shouted at the top
of my lungs. “Sir Brightcheeks. Who picks a name like that? Trying to
make the dragon laugh itself to death?”</p>
<p>Cal’s eyes widened and her nostrils flared and I braced for another
blow. Instead, she turned away. I could see her back heaving with the
effort to stay calm.</p>
<p>“I didn’t pick that name,” she finally said. “He picked it for me. My
troop trainer.”</p>
<p>I remembered the way she’d pinned me with her knee after I’d touched
her hair, and the full meaning of her words came to me. <em>Sorry.
Reflex. It’s okay. I just thought you were…</em> “Oh, Cal. I’m so
sorry.”</p>
<p>She wiped her cheeks and turned around. Her muslin headdress had come
undone; it hung about her face in a loose tangle. “It’s okay. You
couldn’t have known. Sorry about the punch. And your neck. I hope you
don’t bruise.”</p>
<p>“I’ll heal.” I leaned against the wall and sighed. “At least now I
understand why we failed. Carsgrynd’s spell is for virginity freely
given. I’ll go to Bikasby tomorrow and see what I can find in the
regional library.”</p>
<p>“No.” She shook her head, and the tangle of muslin fell to the floor.
“Between the spell and your broken hand, we’ll never transform me in
time.”</p>
<p>“You’re giving up?” I was taken aback. It didn’t seem like her.</p>
<p>“Just making a change of plans.” She studied me thoughtfully. “Is
there any reason the offering has to be a girl?”</p>
<p>I blinked in confusion, until her meaning hit me. “Oh, no. You can’t
be serious.”</p>
<p>She shrugged and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m no fighter, Cal. Look at me. I can’t even kill a spider.”</p>
<p>“I know. You don’t have to kill it. You just have to disarm its lair.
Disable the internal magic that keeps out intruders while the dragon’s
sleeping. I’ll do the rest.”</p>
<p>She smiled again, and in her frank gaze I knew the decision was
mine.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Three days later,</span> after a tripled-up
round of songmilk, pale-eye and skinsmoothe had turned me acceptably
sacrificial, Cal and I stood at the edge of the blackened clearing that
fronted the dragon’s lair. The beast itself was gone; we’d watched the
sky from town until a fat, black dot rose into the air above the
northern caves and spread its wings.</p>
<p>I’d told myself I would be brave, I was a grown man and not a timid
child; but now the moment was here, I was sweaty and trembling and sick
to my stomach.</p>
<p>“Ready?” Cal asked. Thanks to our little tussle three days earlier, I
already looked admirably like a fellow who’d gotten on some fiercer
fellow’s bad side in a tavern brawl and woken up on a dragon’s doorstep.
I’d asked her to brain me again anyway, for my nerves. Cal was confident
the dragon would keep fair-haired, honey-tongued, virginal me alive, but
I harbored a considerable terror that the vital dragon-pleasing datum
would turn out to be womanhood after all.</p>
<p>“Din?”</p>
<p>Hyperventilating as I was, I couldn’t answer her; so I nodded and
closed my eyes, and then she knocked me senseless.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">When I came to,</span> Cal was gone and I
was lying on the hard stone. Moments later—long enough to have my
stomach tie in knots, but not long enough to actually die of terror—the
dragon flew in over the northern forests, an inky blot that kept growing
until it filled a quarter of the sky. My stomach pulled even tighter and
my lungs threatened to explode; I looked to the side, at the simple,
harmless cracks in the stone. Then the dragon’s sinewed wings darkened
the clearing, and I looked up in spite of myself. I had never seen one
so close.</p>
<p>It was a hundred glistening shades of black, from its claws to its
iridescent skin. Its man-sized eyes glittered even in the wan light. It
was more beautiful and more awful than I had imagined.</p>
<p>“Oh, pray tell, what tiny gift is this?” it said, in a voice that
rumbled the forest. I squeezed my eyes shut as its massive snout moved
in and buffeted me; but it did not roast me where I lay. “Oh, a gift
indeed,” it rumbled. “I shall enjoy this one.” It scooped me up in one
enormous claw—not its paw, mind you, but <em>one protruding
claw</em>—and carried me into its den.</p>
<p>The dragon may have been beautiful in an awful way, but its lair was
only awful. It was not the vast, vaulted cave I had always imagined, but
a long tunnel, just high and wide enough for the dragon to move about
in. A layer of pungent muck covered every flat surface; I tried not to
consider what it might be. Though the sky was still light, the lair was
dim, the entrance mostly blocked by its owner’s gargantuan body. The
dragon was a red-limned outline on the cavern floor, glowing from its
own heat. Each exhalation sent a warm gust over me and briefly lit the
cave as the dragon’s nostrils flared like embers.</p>
<p>“Come oil me, worm,” it rumbled. “Or must I wait until you’ve soiled
yourself? Why, you’re just an ineffectual failure, aren’t you? Too
softhearted to act when it really matters. No wonder everyone has always
laughed at you.”</p>
<p>I stood frozen, listening to the dragon hurl my deepest shame at me
like it was written on my face, until it drew me close with a claw.
“Climb up, my little lily liver. I won’t eat you. Not yet. There, on my
back, below the second ring of neck spines, where I cannot reach. Scoop
the oil from beneath the scales and rub it onto them.” I wedged my left
hand under a scale half my size and nearly half my weight, and after a
good deal of wresting and grunting, managed to lift it onto my right
shoulder. I edged forward with my unbandaged left hand until I touched
the steaming glob beneath it. As I rubbed the thick oil onto the scale,
the dragon rumbled again, shaking me so wildly I threw myself against it
and grabbed onto a neck spine—harder than it sounds, with a hand full of
dragon grease. “Oil me!” it commanded, and I reluctantly let go and
resumed rubbing.</p>
<p>I climbed down half an hour later, my right shoulder bruised and my
left arm exhausted from oiling a town square’s worth of scale. “Now
sing,” the dragon commanded. “Something bawdy, something lewd.”</p>
<p>My heart sank then. I wanted nothing more than a barrel of water and
a soft place to sleep, and the night had barely begun. I couldn’t
possibly entertain the dragon until it grew tired. Then I saw Cal in my
mind’s eye, saying <em>we’ll do what we can do with three unbroken
hands</em>.</p>
<p>I would do what I could do.</p>
<p>“There ONCE was a WELL-bosomed WENNNNCH,” I started. It was a popular
tavern tune that I greatly abhorred, which I was sure meant the dragon
would love it. “And this WENCH was a WENCH with a WISHHHH—”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the dragon hissed. “Now, do a little tap dance while you’re
singing.”</p>
<p><em>Just do what you can do</em>. I started shuffling my feet and
swinging my arms. “And her WISH was to—” The dragon rumbled again, but
this time I didn’t squeak.</p>
<p>I do believe it was purring.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">At last the dragon</span> lumbered into a
hollow in the midcavern and slept. My feet were cramped and my throat
was ragged; I was parched and thoroughly exhausted, but there was no
relief for me. Time to find the magic guarding the lair.</p>
<p>I felt my way to the back of the cavern as quietly as I could in the
pulsing, red-tinged darkness. My foot brushed against something soft,
and I heard a weak moan.</p>
<p>“Limra?” I whispered incredulously. She had been sacrificed six days
before; how could she possibly still be alive?</p>
<p>I got a good look at her during the dragon’s next breath. The bag of
bones lying on the cavern floor looked nothing like the healthy girl of
six days past; her eyes blinked dully, her hair was scorched short and
ragged, and her skin was wrinkled where it was not covered in welts.
Everything about her was sunken, as if she had not eaten for a
month.</p>
<p>Every thirteenth day, the townsfolk gather in the northern clearing
at dusk to bind the sacrifice to the standing stone, say a prayer, and
ring the dragon’s gong. Then we shuffle out, back toward town. Someone
lights the first torches, starting a bobbing procession of light that
will lead us back to safety. The girl can see it from her high perch,
and I have always thought its almost holy aura is negated by the
horrible desolation it must create in the girl left behind. It would
seem more fitting that we stumble home in darkness, battering our arms
and legs on the stones as we fall, each bruise and cut reminding us of
our own good fortune.</p>
<p>Now here I was, stumbling over her broken body, freshly aware of the
horror her days here had been. Days spent oiling the dragon and keeping
it endlessly amused while it taunted her with the worst her heart had to
tell her. The distaste I had always felt at performing the job assigned
to me ballooned into a terrible, cutting guilt.</p>
<p>The treaty stipulated that death was to be painless and quick. I’d
always thought the king had scored us a win there. Oh, how the dragons
must have laughed at us. The real torture had always been in the days
that preceded death.</p>
<p>If I survived this night, I was never, ever going to prepare a girl
for sacrifice again.</p>
<p>Limra must have known her end was near. She was in no shape to
delight a dragon that demanded dances and clever songs. It might have
finished her off tonight, if not for the distraction of me. That gave me
some small comfort.</p>
<p>But it was all the comfort either of us would have; without water or
food, the only thing I could do that might help her was find the spell
protecting the lair. “Hang on, Limra,” I whispered; then I forced myself
to step over her fragile body and start looking for the dragon’s
magic.</p>
<p>I had brought a tiny pouch of risanite crystals with me; I knew
dragon’s magic was subtle, like searching for a drop of pink in a sea of
red: look too quickly, and you miss it. It didn’t help that I had no
idea what I was looking for. Core magic? Perimeter magic? Sprites? But
what I missed, the risanite would not; it would vibrate silently when it
touched a source of magic.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">I was more asleep than awake</span> when the
pouch of risanite trembled against my fingers. My eyes would never have
found it on their own: six tiny stones, haphazardly scattered around an
irregular smudge of black powder. A perimeter spell. There would be
other groups of stones and powder, together enclosing the area the
dragon protected. I didn’t have to find them all; I just had to find the
ones that marked off the entrance to the lair, far enough back to expose
the dragon while it slept.</p>
<p>But first: Limra.</p>
<p>The beauty of perimeter magic is that it’s static. It only works if
the perimeter is closed. That means whenever you add or subtract a
marker, for the brief instant when the perimeter snaps from its old
configuration to the new one, it’s useless. Which means you can move
someone from inside to outside the perimeter without, say, waking a
sleeping dragon.</p>
<p>Which meant I could save Limra now, whatever else happened.</p>
<p>I put the pouch of risanite in my pocket and felt my way back to her.
Despite my aching body, I managed to pick her up; the faint light of
dawn helped me creep, step by quiet step, to the mouth of the cave. Cal
had told me the dragon would sleep until midday. I hoped she was
right.</p>
<p>I sank to my protesting knees and rolled Limra onto the floor of the
cave by the entrance. Then I pulled out the risanite and forced myself
back to my feet. I found and disabled six markers guarding the entrance
and the first several feet of the lair. Limra was now outside the new
perimeter. I, by distressingly necessary design, was still inside
it.</p>
<p>I woke to the urgent whisper of my name.</p>
<p>“Din! Open it!” Cal hissed, her eyes wide behind her visor. “I know
you can; you got her out.”</p>
<p>“After you take her home.” My eyes fastened themselves to the water
flask in Cal’s hand.</p>
<p>“Are you mad? Let me in so I can take the dragon while it
sleeps!”</p>
<p>“Her first,” I wheezed, licking my lips.</p>
<p>Cal grunted in frustration. “You take her. I’ll stay and kill the
dragon.”</p>
<p>“Look at me, Cal. I’m in no shape to reach the forest, let alone the
town. You take her. If the dragon sleeps as long as you said, you’ll be
back well before it kills me.” I closed my eyes and turned away. I heard
Cal growl; then I heard soft scraping, as if someone dressed in metal
was gently lifting something from a bed of stone. I had a fleeting
moment to be proud of what I’d done; then sleep reached up with iron
fingers and pulled me back under.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Cal returned</span> and again woke me with
my name. I pulled myself across the cavern floor and disabled a dozen
markers one by one, well into the cavern along the wall furthest from
the sleeping dragon. As long as I hadn’t missed one, the perimeter of
magic keeping Cal out now protected only the dragon’s rearmost haunch. I
dragged myself back to the mouth of the cave and gave Cal a thumbs up,
then rolled onto my back with a quiet groan.</p>
<p>Cal tiptoed in and handed me a gloriously full water flask, which I
drained. Then she gave me a hunk of cheese and some reasonably edible
bread. “It was fresher the first time,” she apologized.</p>
<p>“Ith delithuth,” I whispered through my full mouth. Which was a
terrible, terrible mistake.</p>
<p>I inhaled a crumb of bread and started coughing, which made me panic,
which made me drop the empty flask I was still holding. It hit the floor
of the cave with a cacophonous clang.</p>
<p>The dragon woke at once and was beside Cal in an instant.</p>
<p>“Well, well, what have we here? A slayer—and a female one at that.”
The dragon pushed its enormous snout against her armored chest, then
pulled back and looked at her. “So eager to make your mark on the world.
Too bad you’re such a disappointment to everyone. You always have been,
even as a child. Your parents were relieved to see you carted off by the
outlaws.”</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to it,” I warned, but Cal was already charging with a
dagger in her hand. She ducked and weaved with breathtaking finesse as
it lashed at her, expertly avoiding both its claws and its tail, staying
close so it couldn’t flame her without burning itself. As I pressed
myself against the farthest possible stretch of the cavern wall, Cal
darted in and slashed at the dragon’s underside. Then, breathtakingly,
she jumped onto its forelimb and started climbing. The dragon bellowed
and batted her against the stone wall. She saw it coming and raced
upward, toward its neck, but the blow caught her square. She fell to the
forecavern floor with a sickening crunch.</p>
<p>Fear flooded me, obliterating my body’s pain, and I ran to her.
Despite her helmet, she was bleeding from a gash along her face. But she
was conscious. Barely.</p>
<p>“Take off her armor, worm,” the dragon hissed. “Can’t have her
continue to flail about with her prickly little thorns.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I whispered as I loosened her armor with my good hand.
Cal didn’t answer; I thought she must have passed out. But as I removed
her breastplate, she tucked her dagger into the sleeve above my bandaged
right hand and winked before losing consciousness.</p>
<p>“Now come oil my back, worm,” the dragon said. “Then I’ll let you
watch me kill her. I think a slow death will be most satisfying for one
like her, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth and shuffled toward the foul, appalling thing. A
vast fury kept me on my feet: fury at the dragon, fury at the townsfolk
who shunned me, fury at the endless parade of bullies who had taunted me
as a child. I lowered my head and clasped my left hand around my right
wrist behind my back; with luck, the dragon would think me defeated. The
dagger dropped into my hand. My stomach was sick with dread; I had no
idea where to stab a dragon, and I expected to die. But I would die
fighting a bully. I would die protecting a friend.</p>
<p>The stone rumbled again with the dragon’s laugh. “Come now, little
lily liver, you don’t think you can <em>use</em> that dagger she gave
you, do you?” Its tail whipped around faster than I could follow and
knocked the dagger from my hand, ripping my breeches and rending a gash
down my left leg. I cried out in pain, and the dragon laughed again.
“That’s more like it, little coward. Now come oil me, before I decide to
kill you and keep her instead. So much lovely pain inside her.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t even the semblance of a chance to save Cal now. Every
miserable ache rushed back into my body, and I stumbled. The dragon
flicked its tail and whipped my legs. I lurched forward. Another flick
and whip; I lurched again. I reached its vile forehaunch—how had I ever
thought it beautiful?—and began to climb. Several thousand pain-laced
millennia later, I reached its abominable neck.</p>
<p>My impotent fury reached its peak and I roared. I pulled at the neck
spine beneath my hand, willing it to rip free, to cause this abhorrent
snake some tiny measure of pain before it killed my companion for
sport.</p>
<p>The spine held fast, of course, and the dragon rumbled with
relish.</p>
<p>“Have I made you angry, lily liver?” it purred. “Well, here’s your
chance. Lift the middle scale between the bottom spines. See the orange
spot beneath it? If you weren’t such a useless mollycoddle, you could
kill me.”</p>
<p>I had taken the weight of the heavy scale onto my shoulder; now I
stared at the glowing orange hide, thinned to a soft membrane here above
its pulsing heart. If only I had Cal’s dagger. Oh, I would use it. I
would.</p>
<p>If only I were the kind of man to carry a knife, a letter opener,
<em>anything</em> sharp enough to pierce that pulsing, tender skin. But
all I had were two soft, fleshy hands—and one of those was broken.</p>
<p>“But you wouldn’t dare, would you, my pathetic little coward?”</p>
<p>Then it came to me, as if Carsgrynd himself had parted the heavens
and called down to me: I knew How to Turn Innocent Objects into
Instruments of Terror. I started chanting under my breath.</p>
<p>The dragon wiggled, knocking me forward so the scale scraped down my
shoulder and pinned me beneath it. “Stop your incoherent yammering and
start oiling me, worm, or I’ll slice another bit of you open.” Its tail
writhed upward and grazed my back.</p>
<p>I stopped chanting and pushed myself up, taking the heavy scale with
me. “Oil THIS!” I shouted, and I plunged my broken hand through the
gauzy patch of orange, into the dragon’s fiery innards. The bandaging
vaporized and I screamed as my fingers began to burn. The dragon roared
and bucked. I catapulted from its back; just before the cavern wall
slammed into my head, I shouted Cal’s name.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">I came to with a violent headache</span> and
a hand that hurt so badly amputation would have been a relief. Cal was
leaning over me, her bloodied face inches from mine, and the naked fear
there burned away the last of my muddled fog.</p>
<p>“Din?” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s me,” I croaked.</p>
<p>She let out her breath. “You’re hurt.”</p>
<p>I pulled myself into a half-sit with her help. “Nothing Smantsley’s
physicker and a bottle of Alberian shale whisky can’t fix.” I shifted
and winced. “Well, perhaps a vat of the Alberian.” I looked around the
cavern. “Where’s the dragon?”</p>
<p>She pointed to a gummy, blackened lake on the cavern floor. “Burned
out, bones and all. The standard through-the-heart thing.” She looked
back at me. “Din, how did you do it? I didn’t have time to tell you
where to stab.”</p>
<p>“The dragon told me.” The fury I’d felt before rippled. “Insufferable
beast. It was so sure I was harmless.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t know about the dagger,” Cal said, nodding.</p>
<p>“Oh, it knew. It took it from me. But it didn’t count on
Carsgrynd.”</p>
<p>Cal raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“A spell I memorized as a boy. It requires a length of muslin—” what
else? “—and an incantation, and it temporarily turns whatever’s wrapped
in the cloth into an object as sharp as a sword.” I let out a
half-laugh. “Of course, I was never brave enough to use it.”</p>
<p>“You were today,” Cal said. “You killed a dragon, Din.”</p>
<p>I grinned through my headache. “I did, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>We sat there, smiling at each other like happy idiots. Then Cal said,
“What now?”</p>
<p>“Bikasby,” I declared.</p>
<p>She nodded and pushed herself up. “The library. Help me find a
virginity spell that works, Din, and I’ll be on my way. You’ve done more
than enough to help me. More than I had a right to ask of you.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” I said. “Cal, I bested a bully today. This is the
best thing that could have happened to me.” I tried to stand; my charred
fingers brushed against my shirt and I shrieked. “Well, aside from the
pain part.” I gave up on standing and looked at her. “I’ll keep looking
for a spell, Cal. For you. That is, if you want me to. But I didn’t mean
that. I meant let’s go get Bikasby’s dragon.”</p>
<p>She blinked at me. “You did?”</p>
<p>“You bet.” I grinned at her, and a smile spread across her face.
“And, Cal… you’re amazing. The way you fought the dragon—”</p>
<p>“Was ineffective.” She glanced away and shrugged. “I spent all this
time perfecting a whole new strategy, and it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>“It was phenomenal,” I said. “<em>Cal</em>. It was grace and beauty
in motion. You should have seen the dragon’s face. It had no idea how to
respond. Sheer luck that it had you in such a confined space. Out in the
open, you’d have had him.”</p>
<p>She looked up with a devilish grin. “I would, wouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>I grinned back. “You know it. Now let’s find that vat of Alberian
before the pain <em>really</em> kicks in.”</p>
<p>She came closer and held out a hand. “As you command, Sir
Brokenhand.”</p>
<p>I arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Every good dragonslayer needs a name,” she said, and she winked.</p>
