Builds a Robot with Unexpected Results</h1>

<p>Hi, everyone! Welcome to the latest installment of <em>Liz Makes
Household Robots</em>. I’m pretty excited to show you my latest
creation. This is definitely the most ambitious robot I’ve made yet.
Viewers, meet OrgBa.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
video pans
right
===</code></pre>
<p>I built OrgBa to organize my crap. She’s basically an extensible
robotic arm mounted on a Roomba base with a camera up front and a
Raspberry Pi microcontroller. I’ve loaded her with SimpleCV for image
recognition and the Keras neural-net library for deep learning, plus a
ton of training datasets so she can recognize different categories of
household crap, like “plate” and “book.” It’s all still pretty
off-the-shelf, but so far OrgBa’s working really well. She’s already
alphabetized my books</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans across
bookcase
===</code></pre>
<p>and organized my dishes.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans left
===
hand appears in 
frame, opens
cabinet
===
pans over neat rows
of glasses, then up
to neatly stacked
plates
===</code></pre>
<p>You guys, I am <em>so psyched</em>. I’ll never have to clean again!
Anyway, the <em>really</em> neat thing is that she should eventually
create her own organizational strategies. So she might, say, decide to
bundle dishes into place settings instead of separating the plates and
glasses.</p>
<p>So that’s OrgBa. Tune in next time to see what progress she’s made.
Ciao for now!</p>

<pre class="liz"><code>===

===</code></pre>
<p><span class="newthought">Hi, everyone! Liz again</span> with an
update on OrgBa. So, since my last video, she’s definitely started
creating her own strategies.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans across
bookshelf
===</code></pre>
<p>She reorganized my books by color, which, you know, is kind of cool.
Not strictly <em>useful</em>, but that’s okay. It’s creative. Like…
organizational art. And some of her choices <em>are</em> useful, like
how she gathered all the magazines in the apartment and stacked them by
title and month.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans to floor
===</code></pre>
<p>And that’s really exciting too because, <em>guys</em>, I didn’t train
her to recognize magazines. She figured that out by herself. So she’s
defining her own categories now! Oh, and also: she decided where
magazines “belong” all on her own. Okay, middle of the living room floor
isn’t ideal, but the point is, OrgBa’s thinking for herself. That’s
massive, guys.</p>
<hr />
<pre class="liz"><code>===
video opens
on smiling woman
===</code></pre>
<p><span class="newthought">Hello again, DIY robot lovers!</span> Thanks
for tuning in today. So you’re probably thinking, hey Liz, why are you
standing <em>outside</em> your apartment? Well, let me show you.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans to door
===
hand appears,
turns doorknob
===
thwacking sound
as door stops
halfway
===
advances two feet
into apartment
===
pans across room
===</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, OrgBa’s making rainbows.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans all the way
left, zooms
===</code></pre>
<p>Here’s everything I own that’s red</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans
===</code></pre>
<p>and here’s all the orange</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans
===</code></pre>
<p>and all the yellow</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans
===</code></pre>
<p>and so on, up through violet. So the good news is that I come home to
a redecorated apartment every day, which is kind of cool. The bad news
is that I can’t actually get <em>into</em> my apartment. So for now I’m
staying with my friend Simone. I’m pretty sure this is just part of
OrgBa’s learning process, so I want to ride it out. I mean, we all make
mistakes while we’re learning a new skill, right? She’ll work out the
kinks.</p>
<hr />
<pre class="liz"><code>===

===</code></pre>
<p><span class="newthought">Hi! Liz here,</span> with another exciting
installment of <em>Liz Makes Household Robots</em>. Okay! Let’s see what
wild and crazy thing OrgBa’s done today.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans to door
===
hand appears,
turns doorknob
===
door opens
===</code></pre>
<p>Okay! So the good news is that I can get into my apartment today.
Maybe OrgBa’s over the hump! I can’t wait to see what she’s done.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===

===

===</code></pre>
<p>So, uh, it looks like OrgBa’s created a category called “yarn.”
Funny, I didn’t think I had this much yarn, it’s not like I…</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
whips chaotically
back and forth
===</code></pre>
<p>Wait, where’s the afghan my mom knitted me?</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
zooms in on sofa
===

===
hand appears,

color-coded strands,

by length
===</code></pre>
<p>Is that my grandmother’s heirloom braided rug?!?</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===

===

===</code></pre>
<p>OrgBa! Oh, honey, what have you done?!?</p>
<hr />
<pre class="liz"><code>===

on smiling woman
===</code></pre>
<p><span class="newthought">Hi, guys! Liz here again.</span> I bet
you’ve all been sitting on the edges of your seats, wondering what’s
been going on over here. Well, as you can see, everything’s back to
normal.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans across
moderately disheveled
but otherwise ordinary
room
===</code></pre>
<p>Better than normal, actually. Turns out Grandma bought the “heirloom”
rug at IKEA and lied about it and now she feels guilty, so she gave me
five hundred dollars. Which came in super-useful because OrgBa needed
more yarn.</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
turns 180 degrees
===
pans across
ceiling-high stack of
woven rugs and blankets
===</code></pre>
<p>That’s right: my girl’s an artist. Which maybe just goes to show that
anyone with half a brain would rather be creative than clean house. She
still likes making rainbows, but she’s also branched out to other
styles. I loaded a bunch of artwork into her memory so she could see
what she likes. She spent a day doing Mondriaan, and then Monet, and
then Rothko and Pollock. And now she’s making her own designs!</p>
<pre class="liz"><code>===
pans across

===

faster than the eye
can follow
===</code></pre>
<p>Amazing, right? Guys, I am <em>so proud</em>.</p>
<p>So you may be wondering, hey Liz, what are you going to do with all
those rugs and blankets? Because at this rate they’ll fill up the
apartment pretty soon. Glad you asked! We’re donating the blankets to
Doctors Without Borders, but that still leaves plenty of rugs that need
good homes. So we’ve started a web shop where you can buy your very own
OrgBa original. The money goes to buy more yarn for OrgBa because I tell
you, her yarn habit is WAY expensive.</p>
<p>So that’s it for this episode of <em>Liz Makes Household Robots</em>.
OrgBa’s got her own channel now, <em>How to Weave Blankets and Rugs
Using Just One Arm</em>. It’s got a lot of video of OrgBa weaving but
slowed down like fifty ex so you can actually see how she makes those
complicated patterns of hers. As for me, my next video will be down at
the shop, where I’ll introduce you all to JigsawBa, my new mobile
woodworking robot. I can’t wait to see what <em>she</em> gets up to.
Ciao for now!</p>
