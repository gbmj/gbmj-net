# The Story Behind "Time Travel Is a Voodoo Rite"

(Read [the story](HOME_URL_PHtime-travel-voodoo-rite/) first, if you haven't
yet.)

In 2006, my then-fifteen-year-old [daughter developed brain cancer](DOMAIN_URL_PHcancer-blog/). She
died thirteen months later. As it happened, I was four months pregnant
when she died.

Six years later, I wrote this story to express the way those two events
briefly affected my experience of time. (Though I say brief, the
sensation lasted for years. It did eventually vanish.) The hyperlucid
intensity of the present, when you know it's going to end; the almost
physical presence of the past, when grief is great and circumstance
hands you the sights and smells and sounds.

Most of the details in the story are true: there was a transport
asisstant named Tuggy, and he did bring us some of his super-sweet
homemade lemonade during my daughter's months in the hospital. I did
stand in my kitchen, looking out the window, imagining that future day
when I would stand there and my daughter would be gone. On my son's
birthday, his preschool teacher did read a story about a child who went
to the hospital (though I made up the rhymes). I did sleep on a mattress
beside her bed that last night, I did count her breaths that last
morning (and I had been reading about them for months: Cheyne-Stokes
respiration is the technical term). The daisies, the strawberries, the
morphine, the stuffed cat: all of these are real.

That said, I did take some poetic license. As noted above, I made up the
preschool storybook text (no chance of remembering it two years after
the fact). I also described seeing my newborn son "between my legs," but
his birth was by [necessary
c-section](http://vasaprevia.com/){target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"}; a blue curtain screened off everything below
my chest. "Beside my face when the nurse brought the baby around to me"
didn't have quite the euphony I was looking for.

Because I mostly write science fiction and fantasy, I first sent "Time
Travel" to all the usual SFF short story markets. Those that provided
feedback said it wasn't quite speculative enough. And of course they
were right&mdash;though the rocketship bottle and coiling strands of heart's
blood were clearly fictional, they were also clearly metaphors, even
within the story. So I switched tacks. A fellow writer suggested *Brain,
Child Magazine* might be interested, and to my delight they were.

It remains my favorite story I've written, one that captures what I
consider my strengths as a writer.
