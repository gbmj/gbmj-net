I know the secret to traveling through time.

I hold my daughter's hand as the transport assistant pushes her gurney
down the flourescent hall. The wheels click against the irregular breaks
in the linoleum. Right now I'm all here, in the anti-smell of hospital
clean and the too-cold of hospital air. You can't travel through time
when the present is so insistent.

The assistant's name is Tuggy and he makes fresh-squeezed lemonade so
sweet your eyes turn back in your head. He's gentle, slowing down for
the bump across the elevator threshold, and I'm glad it's him again
today. We roll into Ped Onc and I help him inch my daughter into bed.
What the tumor hasn't paralyzed, radiation and chemo have sucked dry.
She hasn't helped in days.

Tuggy dims the lights as he leaves and I crawl in beside her. I stare at
the unique curve of her skull beneath the skin on her head. There's a
dip in the skyline where they took a sliver out; even so, they can't
tell us what she has. *Two things*, they say, *it's one of two. This one
has an eighty percent survival rate at five years. That one is two
percent.* We're treating eighty, but it will turn out to be two. I don't
know that yet; that isn't what I mean by time travel. Time travel won't
get you from fact to fact. You'd think it would; it seems all gears and
gadgets and the innards of physics, but the truth is surprising. Time
travel is a voodoo rite. You split your heart open and knit together the
past, present and future with your blood, then cast what you've created
into the wind.

I move closer and breathe in her scent. The beep and whir of the
monitors is steady, unlike gurney wheels on linoleum. You need that to
travel in time. I think the voodoo words: someday she might not be here,
and I won't be able to smell her ever again. Here in the present, I lie
with my lips against her hairless, blistered skin and inhale deeply,
sending her scent forward through time in a rocketship bottle to wait
for me, just in case. And suddenly I'm there, in that future where she
died, drying off a fork or a plate and looking out the window at
daffodils in the frost, dissolving the knit of the bottle against the
skin of my chest, remembering the way she smells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

She comes home from the hospital thirty pounds lighter, tied up in IVs
and puking. In time&mdash;ordinary time&mdash;the puking stops and the IVs come
out, and I wheel her through the spring air. She points with the hand
that still works to the little daisies pushing improbably through cracks
in the sidewalk. We eat chocolate-covered cherries for breakfast and
strawberries for lunch, fat red ones dipped in whipped cream and
jimmies. The steroids that keep her brain from bursting with fluid pack
the weight onto her, but it's hard to notice, living in the moment as we
are. We are burning through the present, incinerating every atom of the
here and now. That's another secret to time: the present slows down and
expands to twenty technicolor dimensions as you approach the
singularity, leaving no space for the past or the future.

We are within the event horizon when my daughter stops making
recognizable words. She touches a hand to her head, where cells multiply
like daisies, crowding out her past and her future. We dribble morphine
in by dropper and hope it slakes the pain. I lie on a mattress on the
floor in the silent dark of her bedroom. I don't think I'll sleep with
my arm raised to hold her hand, but I do, and when I wake I see I've
missed her last lucid moments. Her legs and arms are blue and I
recognize her breathing, because I have been reading about this moment
for months. I count the seconds between each fish-out-of-water gasp.
Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty. I count eight times; the ninth breath never
comes.

It's as close to eternity as you'll get.

The universe is frozen while we cut off her nightgown and wash and dress
her. As I fold her hands over the blanket and tuck in the stuffed cat
she's slept with since she was born, time resumes its flow, but
squeezing through the singularity has disoriented it; I cry for the
future loss of the pain I feel in the present. For the dull ache and
blurred wash that will constitute what is left of her beneath the march
of ordinary time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But time, though relentless, is not heartless: it has an unexpected
present of blood for me. I'm four months pregnant when she dies. When my
son is born he cries; the blood-yarn loops and the wind blows, and I see
my daughter between my legs. They wrap him and hand him to me. I look
down and see my son, I whisper his name; then the needles purl again and
I'm with her. It is the ultimate time-traveling gris-gris, this baby in
the present that looks and sounds and smells like that baby in the past.
I cry two kinds of tears in an endless round robin: gratitude for the
visceral experience of holding her again, guilt for letting the past in
to obliterate the here and now of him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time passes, ordinary time, and the ephemeral weave of blood and voodoo
dissolves in its impalpable wind. When I look at my son, I see only him.
One morning, standing in the kitchen, drying the forks and plates, I
look out and see the year's first daffodils. I search for the voodoo
bottle I sent forward in time fifteen months ago and find only a fine
powder, dark like dried blood, its contents long vanished. I have
forgotten the way she smells. It is the first of many things I will
forget as my heart heals, sealing away the long, ropy strands of voodoo
blood.

But time is not heartless: the seal is not perfect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My son turns four, and I am there among the cake-smeared faces when his
preschool teacher&mdash;innocent, uninformed&mdash;reads the day's story. *Sally
said to her mother, I'm feeling quite ill. Mother said, to the doctor!
He'll give you a pill. But Doc said, to the hospital, and quick, on the
double! That thing&mdash;and he pointed&mdash;is awfully big trouble.* A strand
of blood coils into the hand I have pressed to my heart; time's wind
lifts the ends of my hair.

I lean in and breathe deeply of my son until the wind fades. I hold on
to the rope of blood a little longer, until it's time to leave. It bobs
gently against my chest as we walk home hand in hand. By dinner it will
have crumbled to dust.

There will be others.
