<h3 id="eligible-content">Eligible content</h3>
<p>This license applies to the website content for which I am the
copyright holder: my stories, journal entries, photos and drawings. This
includes the MRI images on The Cancer Blog, the css and html used for
the site, and the <a href="https://github.com/gbmj/litesite/">litesite
static site generator script</a> used to build the site.</p>
<p>This license does <em>not</em> apply to works by others: custom story
artwork copyrighted by its artist, and (obviously) anything at an
external link.</p>
<h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3>
<p>All eligible creative content is licensed under a
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>
(CC-BY-SA).</p>
<p>The litesite software is licensed under a <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU General Public
License version 3 or later</a> (GPLv3).</p>
<p>All css and html is in the public domain.</p>
<h3 id="free-as-in-beer">Free as in beer</h3>
<p>I believe that everyone should have access to ideas, even if they
can’t afford to pay for it. The ideas in my writing, artwork and code
are no doubt modest, but they’re what I have to offer. I make them
freely available as an expression of this belief. If you enjoy my work,
please thank me by doing something incredibly kind in the world.</p>
<h3 id="free-as-in-speech">Free as in speech</h3>
<p>I believe that wonderful things happen when people build on ideas
that are freely exchanged. Under the CC-BY-SA license, people are
welcome to share and build on my creative content without asking or
paying me, as long as they acknowledge its origin (the BY clause, credit
must be given to the creator). The SA clause (adaptations must be shared
under the same license) ensures that this freedom is always paid
forward. For software, the GPLv3 ensures the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="commercial-adaptations">Commercial adaptations</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, no one would need to monetize what they create in
order to survive. In our actual world, however, money controls access to
a great many things it shouldn’t. For my creative works I chose a CC
license without the NC clause (non-commercial use only) to honor that
reality, as the GPL does. I make my work free-as-in-beer, but you are
free to request payment.</p>
<p>Here’s a concrete example to help make things clear. The CC-BY-SA
license grants you the right to, say, turn one of my stories into a
movie and charge people money to see it. You <em>don’t</em> have to ask
for my permission, and you <em>don’t</em> have to give me a share of the
profits. You <em>do</em> have to list me and my story in the film
credits, and you <em>do</em> have to make it clear that I haven’t
endorsed your movie. You also <em>do</em> have to let other people use
your movie under the same conditions—so anyone could make a copy of your
movie and show it to others for free (or for payment). If you want to
keep the exclusive rights to distribute and monetize your film, you’re
better off contacting me to license the story under different terms.</p>
