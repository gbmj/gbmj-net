<p>I was born and raised in a small town in North Carolina, in the
American South, where I spent my winters buried in books and my summers
drinking sweet iced tea and catching crabs in the river.</p>
<p>I wrote my first major opus the year my age hit double digits: 1977,
the year Star Wars came out. I sent George Lucas a script for a second
movie, first written by hand and then pecked out on the classroom
typewriter. It was a pretty stirring script, let me tell you. Sadly, I
never heard back. (Hollywood’s a tough nut to crack.) I’ve kept writing
<a href="https://gbmj.net/stories/">stories</a> ever since.</p>
<p>I left home at 15 to attend the North Carolina School of Science and
Mathematics. After high school, I briefly tried my hand at <a
href="https://gbmj.net/drawings.html">art</a>, then earned my bachelor’s
degree in math and did some grad work in computer graphics. After
college, I programmed digital signal processors way down in their geeky
little innards.</p>
<p>I met my husband in 1995, and in 2002, we moved to the Netherlands,
his home country. From 2002 through 2019 I worked as a freelance
translator, with the occasional <a
href="https://gbmj.net/code.html">software project</a> on the side. In 2020
I returned to salaried life for a few years as a full-time tech writer.
Now I’m retired, which means I get to do whatever I want all day. I
recommend it!</p>
<p>Along the way I had four kids, <a
href="https://gbmj.net/cancer-blog/">one of whom died</a>. Raising kids was
awesome but also very intense. Back when I had to show off my employable
skills, this was one of my resumé entries:</p>

<p>(Feel free to nab that for yourself, if it applies.)</p>
<p>I currently live in the Haarlemmermeer polder: surrounded by tulip
fields, a stone’s throw from Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam, and
fourteen feet below sea level.</p>
