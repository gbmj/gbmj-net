<h1 id="a-whole-leaf-dark-and-red">A Whole Leaf, Dark and Red</h1>
<h3 id="by-grayson-bray-morris">by Grayson Bray Morris</h3>
<p>The girl sits in the moist dirt of the wooded lot next door and makes
cities out of acorns and leaves. At night the people in her cities come
up through the laundry hamper in her closet. After her parents say good
night and close her door, she goes to the closet and opens the hamper
for them. She drapes a shirt-sleeve over the edge so they can climb
down. She can hear them milling about before they march to her bedroom
door and under the crack. When she wakes in the morning, they are gone.
And everything in the house is as it should be. Her people are careful
explorers. And kind ones: they always leave her a bit of wet leaf to say
thank you.</p>
<p>Today she is making them a tower. She carefully breaks twenty-six
twigs to the length of her hand. Then she punches precise holes into the
damp, sloping ground and slides the twigs into them, one by one. From
the tower her people will be able to look at the stars. She doesn’t know
how to build them a telescope but she knows her people are clever. And
they have seen her own telescope by her window, each night since her
fifth birthday. They are small enough to climb inside and discover its
secrets.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">The next morning</span> is filled with rain.
After breakfast the girl’s grandmother folds laundry while the girl’s
mother and the new baby nap. The girl builds her people a treasure chest
using matchsticks and glue. She has to build it in her closet or Alice
Whitney might ruin it when she comes to play that afternoon. Inside it
she leaves a piece of mirror she took from the bathroom trash can, and
the spring from a ballpoint pen that ran out of ink. Telescopes need
mirrors, and she thinks they might need springs. She also leaves a bit
of bread for her people.</p>
<p>Alice Whitney doesn’t have a baby at home. When she comes to play the
girl’s mother gives them skeins of yarn for pretend babies. They wrap
their pretend babies in blankets and rock them to pretend sleep. When
the sun comes out the women take the real baby for a walk in his pram,
and the girl and Alice Whitney put their pretend babies in her wagon and
walk behind them. She wants to go check on her people in the woods but
it’s better if she doesn’t while she’s with Alice Whitney. Alice Whitney
isn’t careful about where she puts her feet.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">The next morning</span> the girl checks the
treasure chest. The mirror and the pen spring are gone. There’s a bit of
wet leaf on her telescope, and this is how she knows her people
understood what the mirror and the pen spring were for.</p>
<p>The bread is still there. Her people never take the food she leaves
for them. She wonders what they eat instead, and whether she could eat
it, too. Perhaps they eat leaves.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s rain has caved in their tower. The girl carefully
rebuilds it. She doesn’t see the mirror or pen spring but she doesn’t
know where they keep their laboratory.</p>
<p>At dinner she tells the baby about telescopes. He stares at her from
his bassinet, listening.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">The next morning</span> the baby is dead. He
died in the night and it’s no one’s fault. Everyone is very sad. The
girl is sad, too, especially for the baby. He wasn’t here very long.</p>
<p>The girl wants to check on her people but today they will have to do
without her. Tonight they will know why she didn’t come, when they climb
through her hamper. Perhaps they already know.</p>
<p>The pastor is in the kitchen with her parents. The girl’s grandmother
takes her up to see the baby. His room is very quiet, and he is small
and still in his crib. The girl touches his cheek. It is soft and
cool.</p>
<p>The girl’s grandmother says let’s go downstairs, and I’ll make you
some breakfast. The girl pushes away from the crib and sees a wet leaf
on the floor beneath it. A whole one, very dark and red.</p>
<p>This is how she knows her people are sad about the baby, too.</p>
<p>She takes the leaf down to her mother. Her mother smiles and says
it’s wonderful that she has such kind friends, and to please tell them
thank you.</p>
<p>The girl says she will.</p>
