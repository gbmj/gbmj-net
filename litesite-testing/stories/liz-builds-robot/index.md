# In Which Liz Builds a Robot with Unexpected Results

Hi, everyone! Welcome to the latest installment of *Liz Makes Household
Robots*. I'm pretty excited to show you my latest creation. This is
definitely the most ambitious robot I've made yet. Viewers, meet OrgBa.

~~~~~ {.liz}

I built OrgBa to organize my crap. She's basically an extensible robotic
arm mounted on a Roomba base with a camera up front and a Raspberry Pi
microcontroller. I've loaded her with SimpleCV for image recognition and
the Keras neural-net library for deep learning, plus a ton of training
datasets so she can recognize different categories of household crap,
like "plate" and "book." It's all still pretty off-the-shelf, but so far
OrgBa's working really well. She's already alphabetized my books

and organized my dishes.

You guys, I am *so psyched*. I'll never have to clean again! Anyway, the
*really* neat thing is that she should eventually create her own
organizational strategies. So she might, say, decide to bundle dishes
into place settings instead of separating the plates and glasses.

So that's OrgBa. Tune in next time to see what progress she's made. Ciao
for now!

[Hi, everyone! Liz again]{.newthought} with an update on OrgBa. So,
since my last video, she's definitely started creating her own
strategies.

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans across
bookshelf
===
~~~~~

She reorganized my books by color, which, you know, is kind of cool. Not
strictly *useful*, but that's okay. It's creative. Like...
organizational art. And some of her choices *are* useful, like how she
gathered all the magazines in the apartment and stacked them by title
and month.

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans to floor
===
~~~~~

And that's really exciting too because, *guys*, I didn't train her to
recognize magazines. She figured that out by herself. So she's defining
her own categories now! Oh, and also: she decided where magazines
"belong" all on her own. Okay, middle of the living room floor isn't
ideal, but the point is, OrgBa's thinking for herself. That's massive,
guys.

[Hello again, DIY robot lovers!]{.newthought} Thanks for tuning in
today. So you're probably thinking, hey Liz, why are you standing
*outside* your apartment? Well, let me show you.

~~~~~ {.liz}

pans to door

hand appears,
turns doorknob

As you can see, OrgBa's making rainbows.

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans all the way
left, zooms

~~~~~

Here's everything I own that's red

~~~~~ {.liz}
===

===
~~~~~

and here's all the orange

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans
===
~~~~~

and all the yellow

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans
===

and so on, up through violet. So the good news is that I come home to a
redecorated apartment every day, which is kind of cool. The bad news is
that I can't actually get *into* my apartment. So for now I'm staying
with my friend Simone. I'm pretty sure this is just part of OrgBa's
learning process, so I want to ride it out. I mean, we all make mistakes
while we're learning a new skill, right? She'll work out the kinks.

[Hi! Liz here,]{.newthought} with another exciting installment of *Liz
Makes Household Robots*. Okay! Let's see what wild and crazy thing
OrgBa's done today.

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans to door
===
hand appears,

===

===
~~~~~

Okay! So the good news is that I can get into my apartment today. Maybe
OrgBa's over the hump! I can't wait to see what she's done.

~~~~~ {.liz}

So, uh, it looks like OrgBa's created a category called "yarn." Funny, I
didn't think I had this much yarn, it's not like I...

~~~~~ {.liz}

whips chaotically
back and forth
===
~~~~~

Wait, where's the afghan my mom knitted me?

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
zooms in on sofa
===
lurches toward sofa
===
hand appears,
picks up fistful of
color-coded strands,

Is that my grandmother's heirloom braided rug?!?

~~~~~ {.liz}

~~~~~

OrgBa! Oh, honey, what have you done?!?

[Hi, guys! Liz here again.]{.newthought} I bet you've all been sitting
on the edges of your seats, wondering what's been going on over here.
Well, as you can see, everything's back to normal.

~~~~~ {.liz}
===
pans across
moderately disheveled
but otherwise ordinary
room
===
~~~~~

Better than normal, actually. Turns out Grandma bought the "heirloom"
rug at IKEA and lied about it and now she feels guilty, so she gave me
five hundred dollars. Which came in super-useful because OrgBa needed
more yarn.

~~~~~ {.liz}

turns 180 degrees
===
pans across
ceiling-high stack of
woven rugs and blankets
===
~~~~~

That's right: my girl's an artist. Which maybe just goes to show that
anyone with half a brain would rather be creative than clean house. She
still likes making rainbows, but she's also branched out to other
styles. I loaded a bunch of artwork into her memory so she could see
what she likes. She spent a day doing Mondriaan, and then Monet, and
then Rothko and Pollock. And now she's making her own designs!

Amazing, right? Guys, I am *so proud*.

So you may be wondering, hey Liz, what are you going to do with all
those rugs and blankets? Because at this rate they'll fill up the
apartment pretty soon. Glad you asked! We're donating the blankets to
Doctors Without Borders, but that still leaves plenty of rugs that need
good homes. So we've started a web shop where you can buy your very own
OrgBa original. The money goes to buy more yarn for OrgBa because I tell
you, her yarn habit is WAY expensive.

So that's it for this episode of *Liz Makes Household Robots*. OrgBa's
got her own channel now, *How to Weave Blankets and Rugs Using Just One
Arm*. It's got a lot of video of OrgBa weaving but slowed down like
fifty ex so you can actually see how she makes those complicated
patterns of hers. As for me, my next video will be down at the shop,
where I'll introduce you all to JigsawBa, my new mobile woodworking
robot. I can't wait to see what *she* gets up to. Ciao for now!
