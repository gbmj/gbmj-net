Verb</h1>
<p>by Grayson Bray Morris ⋅ 2020</p>
<p>(Read <a href="https://gbmj.net/litesite-testing/stories/love-is-verb/">the story</a> first, if you
haven’t yet.)</p>
<p>This story sparked a range of responses from my writing group,
including one person who thought it felt melodramatic—which is
understandable, because it throws two improbable deaths into one
750-word space. But as they say, truth is stranger than fiction. All
these things really happened, and happened to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>my teenage <a href="https://gbmj.net/cancer-blog/">daughter’s death from
cancer</a></li>
<li>my brother-in-law’s sudden death at thirty-seven, eight years
later</li>
<li>one of the <a href="https://gbmj.net/cancer-blog/ode-nurse/">angels
disguised as Ped Onc nurses</a> who really did go through the hospital
laundry to find my daughter’s missing sock (though in real life it was
underwear)</li>
<li>another act of unprompted kindness years and years ago, when I was
in my late teens and didn’t have enough to buy a candy bar and a Coke at
a gas station. When I finally went up to the counter after lots of
counting and putting things back down, the clerk said, “The man who just
walked out left two dollars for you.”</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
That murky process that roils and writhes deep in the writing heart spit
them all up together one weekend. And when—almost two years later—the
dust had settled, I saw why. And I finally had my title.</p>
