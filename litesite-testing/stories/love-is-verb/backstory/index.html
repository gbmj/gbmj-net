<p>(Read <a href="https://gbmj.net/litesite-testing/stories/love-is-verb/">the story</a> first, if you
haven’t yet.)</p>
<p>This story sparked a range of responses from my writing group,
including one person who thought it felt melodramatic—which is
understandable, because it throws two improbable deaths into one
750-word space. But as they say, truth is stranger than fiction. All
these things really happened, and happened to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>my teenage daughter’s death from cancer</li>
<li>my brother-in-law’s sudden death at thirty-seven, eight years
later</li>
<li>one of the angels disguised as Ped Onc nurses who really did go
through the hospital laundry to find my daughter’s missing sock (though
in real life it was underwear)</li>
<li>another act of unprompted kindness years and years ago, when I was
in my late teens and didn’t have enough to buy a candy bar and a Coke at
a gas station. When I finally went up to the counter after lots of
counting and putting things back down, the clerk said, “The man who just
walked out left two dollars for you.”</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
That murky process that roils and writhes deep in the writing heart spit
them all up together one weekend. And when—almost two years later—the
dust had settled, I saw why. And I finally had my title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mistakenly dumped my daughter’s underwear into the hospital
laundry. I asked Kim what would happen to it; she said it was gone
forever: the laundry is contracted out and goes to hospitals all over
the country. She said they once lost a ten-thousand dollar heart monitor
that way. Ah, well, I said, no biggie; we can get more.</p>
<p>An hour later, I opened a drawer in my daughter’s room and found a
bag containing the wayward underwear. Kim had gone investigating; the
dirty laundry was still around, and she fished through it all to find
them.</p>
