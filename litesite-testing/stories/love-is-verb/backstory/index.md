# The Story Behind "Love Is a Verb"

by Grayson Bray Morris â‹… 2020

(Read [the story](HOME_URL_PHlove-is-verb/) first, if you haven't yet.)

This story sparked a range of responses from my writing group, including
one person who thought it felt melodramatic&mdash;which is understandable,
because it throws two improbable deaths into one 750-word space. But as
they say, truth is stranger than fiction. All these things really
happened, and happened to me:

- my teenage [daughter's death from cancer](DOMAIN_URL_PHcancer-blog/)
- my brother-in-law's sudden death at thirty-seven, eight years later
- one of the [angels disguised as Ped Onc nurses](DOMAIN_URL_PHcancer-blog/ode-nurse/) who really did go
  through the hospital laundry to find my daughter's missing sock
  (though in real life it was underwear)
- another act of unprompted kindness years and years ago, when I was in
  my late teens and didn't have enough to buy a candy bar and a Coke at
  a gas station. When I finally went up to the counter after lots of
  counting and putting things back down, the clerk said, "The man who
  just walked out left two dollars for you."

\
That murky process that roils and writhes deep in the writing heart spit
them all up together one weekend. And when&mdash;almost two years
later&mdash;the dust had settled, I saw why. And I finally had my title.
