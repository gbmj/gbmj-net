“Time Travel Is a Voodoo Rite”</h1>
<p>by Grayson Bray Morris ⋅ 2018</p>
<p>(Read <a href="https://gbmj.net/litesite-testing/stories/time-travel-voodoo-rite/">the story</a>
first, if you haven’t yet.)</p>
<p>In 2006, my then-fifteen-year-old <a
href="https://gbmj.net/cancer-blog/">daughter developed brain cancer</a>.
She died thirteen months later. As it happened, I was four months
pregnant when she died.</p>
<p>Six years later, I wrote this story to express the way those two
events briefly affected my experience of time. (Though I say brief, the
sensation lasted for years. It did eventually vanish.) The hyperlucid
intensity of the present, when you know it’s going to end; the almost
physical presence of the past, when grief is great and circumstance
hands you the sights and smells and sounds.</p>
<p>Most of the details in the story are true: there was a transport
asisstant named Tuggy, and he did bring us some of his super-sweet
homemade lemonade during my daughter’s months in the hospital. I did
stand in my kitchen, looking out the window, imagining that future day
when I would stand there and my daughter would be gone. On my son’s
birthday, his preschool teacher did read a story about a child who went
to the hospital (though I made up the rhymes). I did sleep on a mattress
beside her bed that last night, I did count her breaths that last
morning (and I had been reading about them for months: Cheyne-Stokes
respiration is the technical term). The daisies, the strawberries, the
morphine, the stuffed cat: all of these are real.</p>
<p>That said, I did take some poetic license. As noted above, I made up
the preschool storybook text (no chance of remembering it two years
after the fact). I also described seeing my newborn son “between my
legs,” but his birth was by <a href="http://vasaprevia.com/"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessary c-section</a>; a
blue curtain screened off everything below my chest. “Beside my face
when the nurse brought the baby around to me” didn’t have quite the
euphony I was looking for.</p>
<p>Because I mostly write science fiction and fantasy, I first sent
“Time Travel” to all the usual SFF short story markets. Those that
provided feedback said it wasn’t quite speculative enough. And of course
they were right—though the rocketship bottle and coiling strands of
heart’s blood were clearly fictional, they were also clearly metaphors,
even within the story. So I switched tacks. A fellow writer suggested
<em>Brain, Child Magazine</em> might be interested, and to my delight
they were.</p>
<p>It remains my favorite story I’ve written, one that captures what I
consider my strengths as a writer.</p>
