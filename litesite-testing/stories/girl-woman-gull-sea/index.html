<h1 id="girl-woman-gull-sea">Girl, Woman, Gull, Sea</h1>
<h3 id="by-grayson-bray-morris">by Grayson Bray Morris</h3>
<p>In her dream she stands halfway across a concrete dam, a placid lake
at her back and a lazy river stretching out below her. Seagulls caw
overhead, trading tales of salt and freedom. She imagines the concrete
melting beneath her feet, letting the water of the reservoir gently wash
her to the sea, where she will float weightless under a bright blue sky.
Until then she will wait here. Nothing can make her go back.</p>
<p>In waking life she stands before a floor-length mirror in her new
pink-and-red-flowered bathing suit while her father roars above his gin
and tonic. <em>No one wants a fat girl</em>, he shouts as he slaps her
stomach. <em>Fat girls end up alone</em>. She is seven.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">In her dream</span> she sits halfway across
a dam, dangling her legs above the sluggish river below. Seagulls above
her make the only sound, sharp as salt in an open wound. She imagines
stretching out her arms and pushing off with both feet, to soar one
weightless second before gravity plunges her into the slowly southbound
water. She will float from there all the way to the sea, and she will
never go back.</p>
<p>In waking life she sits nailed to her dorm-room floor while a boy
from class angrily packs up his books. He’s just said these killing
words: <em>Why are you fighting this? It’s not like anyone else is
jonesing to get into your pants. I thought you’d be grateful</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">In her dream</span> she lies halfway across
a dam, gripping the edge to stop the sky’s reeling. A lone seagull mews
overhead, freedom a faint echo in its salted refrain. She imagines the
tired concrete breaking beneath her, burying her under a thousand tons
of angry water before washing her broken body to the sea. Still, it’s
better than going back.</p>
<p>In waking life she is barely awake, living from one Percocet refill
to the next.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">Years go by,</span> dreamless, and where she
thinks joy should be she feels hollow. She blames it on the Percocet,
but even after she gets clean the hollow’s still there.</p>
<p>She stays clean anyway, so joy will have a way to find her, if it
can. If it still wants to.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">She moves to the coast</span> and starts
spending her mornings by the sea, the salt of the gulf rich in her
mouth, the gulls wheeling and diving above her. She walks along the
surf, facing backward so she can watch the water rush into her
footprints, and discovers, one day, that joy has answered her
letters.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">At a local vintage shop</span> she tries on
a little black dress in size 24. Outside she hears a mother berating her
daughter. <em>Suck in your stomach. No one wants a fat girl.</em> For a
moment she’s hanging off the edge of a dam hoary with age above a dusty
riverbed. The gulls are gone and the only sound is her own panting. It
would be so easy to stay here until her fingers go numb and she
falls.</p>
<p>But she comes back.</p>
<p>She throws open the door of the changing room and marches ten steps
to the girl slouched before the mirror. “You look beautiful,” she says.
Then she slaps the mother, hard. “Don’t. You. Ever. Not ever again.”</p>
<p>She wears the little black dress out of the shop, the tag still
hanging down her back. She turns as she leaves, searching for the girl,
and when their eyes meet she winks.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">In her dream</span> she is seven and the dam
is breaking beneath her and she is falling, tumbled by raging water,
down and down and down and down and down and</p>
<p>In her dream strong hands pull her from the sea. There is something
familiar about the voice of the woman who rubs her dry and wraps her in
a blanket and hands her a thermos of hot chocolate before sitting in the
sand ten steps away. Familiar, and friendly, and safe.</p>
<p>She sips her chocolate and stares at the stranger who saved her. The
woman is old and fat and her eyes wrinkle when she smiles. She is
wearing the same thing the girl is wearing: a pink-and-red bathing suit
covered in flowers. The girl’s eyes widen, and the woman laughs and
holds out her arms. The girl leaps into them and buries herself in the
woman’s soft warmth.</p>
<p>“You were the hardest one to find,” the woman whispers as she strokes
the girl’s hair. “But I never stopped trying. Welcome home.”</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="newthought">In waking life</span> she runs into the
water like a child, diving under the waves again and again. When, hours
later, she tires, she lies on the sand in the light of the sun, her
greying hair wet and salty on her joyous face, and listens to seagulls
chatter in a boundless sky.</p>
