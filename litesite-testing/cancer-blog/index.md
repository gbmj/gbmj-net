<summary>* My eldest child has a brain tumor.* </summary>

Those were the first words of my second-ever blog post back in 2006. I'd started the blog as a place to store ideas and random musings, but it soon became The Cancer Blog, read by friends and family and very many strangers around the globe. It ended up a treasure trove of blow-by-blow reporting that I've been grateful to have ever since. 

After my daughter died, I eventually took the blog down; I created a less personal site, Sadie's Brain Tumor, to share the kind of what-does-this-mean details I'd scoured the web for when we were in the thick of things. Now, two decades later, I think it's precisely the personal that was so comforting to me back then. I felt less alone because other people shared not only their MRIs and symptoms, but their days and nights and grief. 

Her real name was Meghan, by the way.
