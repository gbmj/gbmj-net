<h1 id="my-eldest-child-has-a-brain-tumor.">My eldest child has a brain
tumor.</h1>
<p>Those were the first words of my second-ever blog post back in 2006.
I’d started the blog as a place to store ideas and random musings, but
it soon became The Cancer Blog, read by friends and family and very many
strangers around the globe.</p>
<p>Our daughter lost her battle with brain cancer, and in time the blog
seemed too intimate to keep online. But I wanted a way to share Meghan’s
story with others seeking the kind of personal, blow-by-blow information
I had found so useful while we were in the thick of things. So I
distilled the essence of Meghan’s journey to create this website. I hope
it helps you feel a little less alone during a very difficult time.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-signs-of-trouble">The first signs of trouble</h2>
<h3 id="september-2006">September 2006</h3>
<p>Meghan stumbled on the stairs at school in early January. It seemed
like she’d injured her right knee, so she started physical therapy.
After four weeks her knee was getting worse, not better, and she was
starting to have trouble with her right hand. On October 6, the physical
therapist sent Meghan for an immediate MRI.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-sclerosis">Multiple sclerosis</h2>
<h3 id="october-2006">October 2006</h3>
<p>The MRI revealed a large mass in Meghan’s right frontal lobe, as well
as some smaller smeary areas in her left hemisphere. The radiologist
felt it looked most like MS, not a tumor, based on the multiple lesions
that were smeary and not solid. Meghan started on five days of
dexamethasone, a steroid that should stop her current MS attack.</p>
<p>By now, Meghan was no longer able to stand and walk alone; her right
leg wouldn’t cooperate with her. Her right hand was in better shape than
her leg, but still impaired. Meghan moved over to the rehab wing of the
hospital to try to recover as much functionality as possible.</p>
<h2 id="brain-tumor">Brain tumor</h2>
<h3 id="november-2006">November 2006</h3>
<p>After two weeks on the rehab floor, Meghan wasn’t improving. Her
doctors ordered another MRI on October 27. Contrary to expectations,
Meghan’s lesions had grown, which meant she didn’t have MS. Meghan
underwent a biopsy of the top right mass four weeks after her first
MRI.</p>
<p>Meghan’s pathologist identified the tumor tissue as very aggressively
malignant (stage IV), but he wasn’t able to determine precisely what
kind of tumor she had. In the end three different pathologists around
the world took a shot at Meghan’s tumor; none could positively identify
it. It contained characteristics of both a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
and a supratentorial PNET. Three weeks after the biopsy, we finally had
a diagnosis (PNET) and a treatment plan.</p>

<h4 id="from-the-blog">From the blog:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>7 NOVEMBER 2006</p>
<p>My eldest child has a brain tumor. In fact, she has several probably
cancerous areas spread throughout her brain: one very large ball in the
right hemisphere, and smeary areas elsewhere. We don’t yet know exactly
what she has, and making a diagnosis has turned out to be hard. Her
neurologist describes her situation as “atypical, unusual, and
baffling.”</p>
<p>17 NOVEMBER 2006</p>
<p>Though a definite diagnosis has eluded us, one thing is certain: my
fifteen-year-old daughter has aggressive primary malignant brain tumors.
The pathologist at Johns Hopkins grades them as 4+ on a 1-4 severity
scale. They are not PNETs or germ cell tumors. The doctors feel they are
probably gliomas of some kind.</p>
<p>18 NOVEMBER 2006</p>
<p>The written report from Johns Hopkins arrived yesterday. My
daughter’s tumors have the radiologic signature of gliomatosis cerebri,
but Johns Hopkins felt it could also be supratentorial PNET. The good
news is that some people do survive s-PNET. Pretty much no one survives
gliomatosis cerebri.</p>

begin</h2>
<h3 id="november-2006-1">November 2006</h3>
<p>On November 20, Meghan had surgery to implant a Port-A-Cath in her
chest. Two days later she began 6.5 weeks of radiation therapy, combined
with daily carboplatin and weekly vincristine. She did not receive
treatments on weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>Meghan received targeted radiation to the top right tumor site for
five days, then 22 days of full craniospinal radiation (covering her
entire head and spine), then five more targeted treatments. Her last day
of treatment was January 5.</p>
<h2 id="early-side-effects">Early side effects</h2>
<h3 id="novemberdecember-2006">November–December 2006</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first little clumps of Meghan’s hair began to fall out about two
weeks into treatment. (Radiation / chemotherapy)</li>
<li>Meghan gradually felt more and more nauseated; about four weeks in
she began vomiting, at first once a day but up to four or five times a
day by the end. (Radiation / chemotherapy)</li>
<li>Meghan’s skin on her head and along her spine became red and started
peeling, much like a sunburn. (Radiation)</li>
<li>Meghan developed ‘chipmunk cheeks’, acne on her face and chest, and
stretch marks over much of her body. (Dexamethasone)</li>
<li>Meghan lost nearly twenty pounds during treatment. At the end she
was barely eating: one french fry or one sip of milk on a good day.
(Radiation / chemotherapy)</li>
<li>Meghan’s short-term memory started to worsen; she would forget
recent visitors, what she last ate. (Radiation / tumor)</li>
<li>Meghan stopped having periods during treatment as a result of the
assault on her bone marrow. (Radiation / chemotherapy)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="from-the-blog-1">From the blog:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>23 NOVEMBER 2006</p>
<p>Her memory is slightly worse; she doesn’t remember things people have
already told her or her radiation session yesterday. She’s having
occasional trouble finding her words, which frightens her. She couldn’t
remember how to spell <em>excited</em> and <em>exhausted</em> when
texting a friend. She’s noticed changes in her breathing.</p>
<p>None of this is a surprise; she is seven weeks into this – eleven if
you count the month before she had her first MRI, when we thought she’d
just pulled a knee ligament – and she’s had no tumor-specific treatment
before Tuesday. Those are alarming numbers if she has gliomatosis
cerebri: without therapy, patients with glioblastomas uniformly die
within 3 months.</p>
<p>I can’t find statistics for how alarming they are if she has
s-PNET.</p>
<p>27 DECEMBER 2006</p>
<p>She’s had two blood transfusions in the past week for her very low
red blood cell count. They’ve given her more energy. She’s lost weight;
I can feel sharp hipbones under her pants. Anorexia has kicked in as
promised: she hasn’t eaten in four days. We worked very hard to get
seven peas, two bites of chicken, two bites of stewed apple, and one
bite of rice into her over the course of the day.</p>
<p>2 JANUARY 2007</p>
<p>Her memory was shockingly bad today. We’ve noticed lapses in her
short-term recall, and she’s talked about it some herself. But today was
worse than we’d seen before.</p>
<p>11 JANUARY 2007</p>
<p>She got a DuoDerm patch at the base of her spine, to protect the skin
there. It’s starting to get red from all the friction of moving around
in bed. Her back is peeling like a hefty sunburn; her scalp is mostly
peeled out.</p>

<h3 id="january-5-2007">January 5, 2007</h3>
<p>Meghan was worn out by the end of treatment, too tired even to
celebrate making it so far on her last day of therapy. But we were all
happy to mark the start of her recovery and begin counting down to the
next MRI. Had her treatment worked?</p>
