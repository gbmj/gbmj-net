<h1 id="my-eldest-child-has-a-brain-tumor.">My eldest child has a brain
tumor.</h1>
<p>Those were the first words of my second-ever blog post back in 2006.
I’d started the blog as a place to store ideas and random musings, but
it soon became The Cancer Blog, read by friends and family and very many
strangers around the globe. It ended up a treasure trove of blow-by-blow
reporting that I’ve been grateful to have ever since.</p>
<p>After my daughter died, I eventually took the blog down; I created a
less personal site, Sadie’s Brain Tumor, to share the kind of
details—“what does this MRI mean? where are we in the process?”—I’d
scoured the web for when we were in the thick of things. Now, with
almost twenty years of distance, I think it’s precisely the personal
that was so comforting to me back then. I felt less alone because other
people shared not only their MRIs and symptoms, but their days and
nights and grief.</p>
<p>Her real name was Meghan, by the way.</p>
