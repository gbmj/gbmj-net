<h3 id="nov-2006">7 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>My eldest child has a brain tumor. In fact, she has several probably
cancerous areas spread throughout her brain: one very large ball in the
right hemisphere, and smeary areas elsewhere. We don’t yet know exactly
what she has, and making a diagnosis has turned out to be hard.</p>
<p>Her neurologist describes her situation as “atypical, unusual, and
baffling.” Her presenting symptoms (weakness on her right side, known as
hemiparesis) and initial MRIs and spinal tap led to a tentative
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in early October. When her symptoms
didn’t improve after steroids and physical therapy, another MRI led to a
biopsy. A week’s staining and staring at the extracted tissue came back
inconclusive; now the sample is off to an expert at Johns Hopkins for
further study.</p>

Peak to Appalachian Slope….Maybe</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-1">8 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>The neurosurgeons and neuropathologists discussed my daughter’s case
again today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feelings amongst the group are that this is a high grade tumor,
but the origin or type is still unknown. Everyone agrees that it has
defied any usual patterns that we know of. The pathologist does not
think it arose from the glia, thus it does not look like what we call a
glioma, or even gliomatosis cerebri. “High grade” means that it is
aggressive, in that the cells are dividing and growing out of control.
This is very uncharacteristic for gliomatosis. It usually means it will
be more amenable to treatment, if the cells are growing fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this information, I’ve gone searching the ’Net again, and
here are my candidates (almost entirely unfounded; I’m no doctor) for
what she has:</p>
<ul>
<li>PNET: survival at 5 years is 50 to 60%.</li>
<li>Medulloblastoma: a specific PNET; survival at 5 years can be as high
as 85%.</li>
</ul>
<p>My daughter’s prognosis is likely to be less rosy, since there is
more than one tumor site and surgical removal is probably out of the
question for some of them.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot of room between these numbers and “dead in 12
months.”</p>
<h2 id="its-still-a-mystery">It’s Still a Mystery</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-2">15 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>The tentative reply from Johns Hopkins is in: they, too, are unable
to pinpoint what kind of brain cancer my daughter has. I had no idea
this could happen. Once you have an honest-to-goodness real-live sample
of tumor tissue, how can you not be able to discover what makes it tick?
To lay bare all its secrets?</p>
<p>Clearly I am operating under mistaken assumptions, because the
capable doctors at UNC Hospitals and at Johns Hopkins have done all they
can, and done it well. I’m just surprised. Astonished. I had no idea. I
wonder how often it happens. Is my daughter a supreme anomaly in the
world of brain cancer, or is she joined by, say, 2% of her tumorous
peers?</p>
<p>In any case, we have to decide on treatment. The tumors aren’t likely
to spontaneously vanish.</p>
<h2 id="radiation-and-chemotherapy">Radiation and Chemotherapy</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-3">17 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>Though a definite diagnosis has eluded us, one thing is certain: my
daughter (15) has aggressive primary malignant brain tumors. Dr. Berger,
the pathologist at Johns Hopkins, grades them as 4+ on a 1-4 severity
scale. They are not PNETs or germ cell tumors. The doctors feel they are
probably gliomas of some kind. Alas, gliomatosis cerebri is still in the
running.</p>
<p>They will not be attempting surgical removal.</p>
<p>She begins 6.5 weeks of radiation therapy next Monday or Tuesday. The
doctors are hopeful they won’t need to target her entire head; she may
lose hair just on the top and upper sides. (I have to wonder if that’s
any consolation to her . . . unless the Roman tonsure comes into
vogue.)</p>
<p>She will also receive chemotherapy, either during or after her
radiation treatment depending on her side effects. I don’t know if the
chemotherapy will finish off what hair she still has. I suppose that
depends on the specific cocktail she receives; my grandfather (bone
marrow cancer) lost all his hair, but my father-in-law (colon cancer)
lost none.</p>
<p>Her stepfather and I are getting flu shots today in preparation for
our second trip to see her. I am by nature a reluctant vaccinee, but a
little thimerosal and aluminum in my system seems a small price to pay:
in exchange, I’ll know I did what I could (and what was asked of me) to
protect her compromised immune system.</p>
<h2 id="craniospinal-and-new-chemo-drugs">Craniospinal and New Chemo
Drugs</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-4">18 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>The written report from Johns Hopkins arrived yesterday. My
daughter’s tumors have the radiologic signature of gliomatosis cerebri,
but Johns Hopkins felt it could also be supratentorial PNET. The good
news is that some people do survive s-PNET. Pretty much no one survives
gliomatosis cerebri.</p>
<p>My daughter’s treatment plan has thus changed to follow the s-PNET
protocol. She will receive 2 weeks of radiation to the primary tumor
site and full craniospinal radiation for the next 4 weeks. (So long to
enough hair for even the Roman tonsure.) Her quality of life will be
dismal during that time; craniospinal radiation causes anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, sore throat, and swallowing issues. But the radiologist says
this is her best shot treatment-wise.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy will start after Thanksgiving. She will receive
Vincristine instead of Temodar (the choice before the Johns Hopkins
report arrived).</p>
<p>My husband and I spoke directly with the radiologist last night. He
was very straight up about my daughter’s prognosis. I really appreciated
that. I’ve read enough to know she has little chance of surviving long.
It’s comforting to hear her doctor confirm that: it’s so hard not
knowing. Reading doom and gloom, but hoping you’re reading the wrong
things. Unsure whether to be as frightened and sad as you are. Unable to
come to terms with her disease, because you aren’t sure you have the
right information.</p>
<h2 id="quality-of-life-and-hard-decisions">Quality of Life and Hard
Decisions</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-5">20 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter has four parents. Her father and I divorced when she was
2. We are both remarried to wonderful people who love her. She lived
with her stepfather and me until she was 12, moving with us from the US
to the Netherlands when she was 10, then returned to the US to live with
her father and stepmother.</p>
<p>Her life hasn’t been an easy one. She has a diagnosis of Asperger
syndrome and a tentative diagnosis of borderline. She is a very
difficult person, through no fault of her own. Some circuit never got
connected for her, something didn’t develop as it should; we don’t know
exactly what happened. But she has worn out the people who most love
her, and burned a lot of bridges behind her.</p>
<p>Now this. It seems unreal. How can so much misfortune strike a single
life?</p>
<p>She’s 15. At that age, you’re old enough to understand death. You’re
mature enough to hear the truth about what’s happening to you, and what
your odds are. And I believe you have the fundamental right to decide
what your treatment will be.</p>
<p>But our daughter is only 15 physically and mentally. Emotionally,
she’s closer to 3. We four parents feel she might never fully understand
her situation. She has the right to hear the truth. But can we be sure
she truly understands the decision she’s making? If we proceed with the
craniospinal radiation and chemotherapy, her life will be a living hell.
She will want to stop, will probably beg us ceaselessly to make it stop.
But does she really want to stop, to give up and accept death sooner
rather than later?</p>
<p>We parents have been asking ourselves and each other if treatment is
even the right path. Her prognosis is dismal. Are a few extra months
wired to the gills in a hospital, with a pulse but not much else, worth
the torture? Is that truly better than spending half as long in full
possession of your mind and body, perhaps even out in the sunshine
eating ice cream and feeling like a person instead of a disease?</p>
<p>After surgery removed the entire cancerous section of his colon, my
father-in-law had preventive radiation and chemotherapy. Compared to
what my daughter will get, it was baby stuff. He didn’t get sick; he
didn’t lose his hair. He certainly didn’t lose half his IQ, become
infertile, and end up with a broken metabolism. He was just very tired.
And he knew that he was almost certainly going to live out the rest of
his natural lifespan.</p>
<p>He told us last night that despite its relative mildness, he had a
very hard time summoning the will to keep doing his treatment. His arms
burned like the devil for days after each chemo session. Even now, a
year later, he has residual problems in his hands and feet.</p>
<p>And his treatment was a fraction of what my daughter will endure.</p>
<p>My father put it well: it sounds like a treatment you might survive
but wish you hadn’t. And for what gain? 14 months of constant hell
instead of 3 months of gradual decline? Those are the statistics. It
doesn’t sound too hard to me. But here’s the kicker: can we be certain
she won’t be one of the miracles her doctors have treated, like the boy
who beat the odds and is now a medical resident? Or the woman who beat
the odds 23 years ago and is still going strong? Who knows; my
daughter’s miracle may even include closing the circuit, completing the
development of whatever went wrong. She might be healthier than before.
Who can say?</p>
<p>All we have are the odds. And the odds are grim.</p>
<h2 id="relief-and-a-thrill-of-hope">Relief, and a Thrill of Hope</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-6">21 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>Last night we four parents had a conference call with our daughter’s
primary doctor. My husband and I had prepared a slew of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the prognosis in our daughter’s specific case, given the
extent, location, and size of her tumors and the fact they aren’t going
to be resected?</li>
<li>How quickly will she decline with no treatment, and what will her
decline be like? (How drawn out, how painful?)</li>
<li>With the best-shot treatment (craniospinal radiation, Vincristine et
al), what will her life be like during and after, and how much time will
it buy her?</li>
<li>Ditto for the original treatment plan (tumor-area-only radiation,
Temodar).</li>
<li>How likely are specific treatment side effects in her case (IQ loss,
memory loss, pituitary issues, infertility, metabolic problems)?</li>
<li>How permanent are these side effects?</li>
<li>How much vomiting are we talking about: once a day, once an hour,
during administration, continually?</li>
<li>If we start treatment and decide to stop, will her quality of life
already be permanently affected for the worse?</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turned out, my need for answers vanished two minutes into the
call: my daughter wants to fight for her life. Yes, she understands her
odds; yes, she understands how ill she will become. She understands that
even then, she may still die. And yet she wants to fight.</p>
<p>It no longer matters whether treatment is horrible, side effects are
permanent, the outlook barely changes. She wants to do it. She is
prepared to endure the nastiness. She chooses to fight for the miracle,
the 5%, the lucky break.</p>
<p>The immense relief that suffused me upon hearing this surprised me. I
hadn’t realized how heavily making this decision for her weighed on
me—on all of us. But what surprised me more was the hope. I still know
she’s unlikely to make it—her doctor said her chances are much less than
50-50, and her tumor is “very worrisome”—yet I’m buoyed by her
choice.</p>
<h2 id="suspense">Suspense</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-7">22 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>I’m desperate to know how my daughter’s first radiation session went
yesterday. How does she feel?</p>
<p>We called last night as usual (midnight our time, to catch her at 6
PM her time) but didn’t reach her. We texted (“how did it go? We love
you and we’re thinking of you”) but haven’t heard back.</p>
<p>It’s far too early to call her now; we’ll wait another four hours or
so.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-part-i">Resolution, Part I</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-8">22 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>I got a stranger on the phone when I called my daughter this
afternoon. I must have the wrong number, he said; they were admitted
last night.</p>
<p>We finally got hold of my ex-husband. Our daughter has been moved to
a new room on the oncology floor. He said the radiation session was
quick and painless. Through the holiday weekend she’ll be getting
tumor-area-only radiation; full craniospinal will begin next week.
Chemotherapy begins next week too.</p>
<p>She wasn’t in when we called just now; probably at physical therapy.
Her second radiation session will be around 3 PM East Coast time.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-part-ii">Resolution, Part II</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-9">23 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>We spoke with our daughter last night around 6 PM her time. She
sounded tired and a little down. She wasn’t sure how many radiation
treatments she’d already had (two), but they were short and they didn’t
hurt. She’s not in any pain; she doesn’t feel sick.</p>
<p>Yet, she said. She doesn’t feel sick yet. So she hasn’t forgotten
what she’s facing.</p>
<p>We’ll be there in four more days. I wish we were there now.</p>
<h2 id="another-valley">Another Valley</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-10">23 Nov 2006</h3>
<p><strong>valley 2 a</strong> : a low, gloomy, or fearsome place or
situation «the valley of the shadow of death»</p>
<p>We got another middle-of-the-night call last night, this one at a
respectable 6:15 AM our time. My ex-husband and his wife had just spent
two hours calming our daughter. Her panicky evening calls to them are
becoming frequent. The day ends and her visitors leave; she has several
hours to get through before her sleep medication arrives.
Distractionless hours, full of time to think.</p>
<p>They called because they see her declining. Her memory is slightly
worse; she doesn’t remember things they’ve already told her or her
radiation session yesterday. She’s having occasional trouble finding her
words, which frightens her. She couldn’t remember how to spell
<em>excited</em> and <em>exhausted</em> in a text to a friend. She’s
noticed changes in her breathing.</p>
<p>None of this is a surprise; she is seven weeks into this—eleven if
you count the month before she had her first MRI, when we thought she’d
just pulled a knee ligament—and she’s had no tumor-specific treatment
before Tuesday. Those are alarming numbers if she has gliomatosis
cerebri:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without therapy, patients with GBMs uniformly die within 3
months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t find statistics for how alarming they are if she has
s-PNET.</p>
<p>I wish we were there now.</p>

<h3 id="nov-2006-11">26 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter wants to shave her head. She plans to do it today. Her
father surmises it’s one thing she can control in a pretty helpless
situation.</p>
<p>She’s going to donate her hair to a program that makes wigs for
children who’ve lost theirs. I wonder if she could get her own hair back
as a wig. Somehow this idea amuses me.</p>
<p>We’re flying out at 1 PM today. We hope to make the drive from DC to
NC in time to see her before her operation tomorrow morning: she’s
getting a permanent IV for the chemo.</p>
<h2 id="visit-day-one">Visit Day One</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-12">28 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>Our daughter didn’t shave her head. She was exhausted on Sunday, so
lethargic that my ex-husband and his wife were very worried about her.
Yesterday, the day we arrived, was a much better day.</p>
<p>She’s in relatively good spirits in a nearly unworkable situation.
She has almost no control over her right arm and leg and must thus be
helped by two nurses every time she wants to pee. Her new port-a-cath
hurts, much like a nasty gash in your hand from a kitchen knife; the
pain will subside as the wound heals, but it’s pulled and pushed every
time she’s helped to stand.</p>
<p>She was terrified after yesterday’s radiation treatment: she stared
blankly out in front of her as she lay on the brancard waiting for Tuggy
to come wheel her back. I stroked her hair and asked her yes/no
questions; she wasn’t able to speak. Are you tired, or scared, or both?
Shake. Are you tired? Shake. Are you scared? Nod.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, while I was scratching her back and my husband
was off getting us some food, she said, “You know, I might die from
this.”</p>
<p>She has one last targeted radiation treatment today; full
craniospinal begins tomorrow and will continue for four weeks. Then
she’ll have another six targeted treatments. Chemotherapy begins today.
She’ll get carboplatin for about 15 minutes each day and vincristine as
a “push”—a shot directly into her catheter—once a week. Chemo is daily
at 11 AM; radiation is daily at 3 PM.</p>
<p>Significant side effects—hair loss, metabolic problems, thyroid
problems—will take 10 to 14 days to begin; nausea may begin immediately.
Her throat is sore and it’s hard to swallow; this will also worsen.</p>
<p>We left her drifting off to sleep at 10:45 PM, after the Ativan and
Seroquel started to work their magic.</p>
<h2 id="visit-day-two">Visit Day Two</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-13">29 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter felt much worse yesterday. She didn’t sleep well and was
still dozing when we arrived at 8:30 AM. When she woke, she was grumpy
and frustrated. Pretty much the whole day went like that, with brief
periods where we were able to coax a smile from her.</p>
<p>Despite receiving Zofran (ondansetron) before her chemotherapy, she
was nauseated much of the day. She couldn’t get comfortable in bed. She
used a bedpan instead of getting up to the bedside commode.</p>
<p>When she’s miserably uncomfortable like that, everything is “no,” “I
don’t care,” “it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>She was again terrified before and after her radiation treatment; I
can only imagine how terrified she was during: we have to wait in the
lobby. The Ativan only takes the edge off her anxiety.</p>
<p>Despite her loud protests, I insisted she get a sponge bath. This
morning she’ll have a student nurse one on one until noon; I plan to ask
the nurse to bathe her and wash her hair.</p>
<h2 id="visit-day-three">Visit Day Three</h2>
<h3 id="nov-2006-14">29 Nov 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter’s morning was crappy, but she had a really good period in
the afternoon. If it becomes a pattern, we want to take advantage of it:
get her out of her room, play games, make cards, visit the butterfly
garden.</p>
<p>She had her first full craniospinal radiation treatment today. Her
anxiety level was noticeably lower today before and after radiation. She
also had a CT scan to see if there’s a reason for her recent bladder and
bowel trouble: she wet her bed several times last night and had another
accident this morning. Needless to say, these make her even more
miserable than she already is.</p>
<p>She got another sponge bath today, and we washed her hair—sort of. We
used a hospital shampoo that doesn’t have to be rinsed out. The result
isn’t stellar. I’ve already prepped her for a real honest-to-goodness
shower with me tomorrow: we’ll get the nurses to help her into the
shower, and then she and I will relax under the streaming warm water and
I’ll gently massage her scalp. I can’t wait. She is less enthused, but
open.</p>
<p>I’m slowly learning the names of all her drugs. Synthroid. Pepcid.
Colace. Decadron. Zofran. Vincristine. Carboplatin. Ativan.
Seroquel.</p>

<h2 id="visit-day-four">Visit Day Four</h2>
<h3 id="dec-2006">1 Dec 2006</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a better day, though it got off to a rocky start. The
occupational therapist, a nurse assistant and I helped my daughter
shower. I finally got to wash her hair! It was a Herculean ordeal. To
add agony to exhaustion, the dressing on her venous catheter got wet
despite the baggie, and when the nurse went to flush the port, it
didn’t. They had to put in a new needle, and because they didn’t want to
risk it clotting off, they couldn’t numb the area with Emla first.</p>
<p>We were able to get outside for a short while in the afternoon, but
my daughter was feeling very nauseated.</p>
<p>Her first hair has fallen out: a tiny clump of 15 or so hairs, root
and all.</p>
<p>She ate some of the macaroni my husband cooked up for her, the recipe
our neighbors used to make when she’d have dinner with them. She also
ate lots of strawberries and blueberries. Tuggy, who wheels her very
tenderly to and from radiation, gave her some of his homemade lemonade.
Talk about good! Sweet enough to bring you out of a diabetic coma, but
tart and lemony and hard to put down.</p>
<p>My husband will be flying back to the Netherlands on Sunday. I’ll be
staying here. I can’t imagine leaving. I really miss my other two
children; we hope to get them over here around Christmastime. I won’t
have seen them for four weeks by then.</p>
<p>There’s little to no space at the Ronald McDonald House, so our
friends Dave and Rita have graciously offered to let me keep staying
with them. They’ll drive me back and forth to the hospital every day.
These are the times when you just have to let go of not wanting to
impose on others. This is what friends are for.</p>
<h2 id="visit-days-five-and-six">Visit Days Five and Six</h2>
<h3 id="dec-2006-1">2 Dec 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter felt miserable through Friday morning, but she had a
pretty good four hours from 2 to 6 PM. We wheeled her outside into the
balmy North Carolina air for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>She was again much calmer before and after radiation.</p>
<p>She had another visualization therapy with Alyssa, the
psychologist.</p>
<p>I contracted a mild stomach virus and spent Friday night throwing up.
We got to the hospital quite a bit later than usual Saturday, around
10:45 AM, and my daughter was very unhappy. She was starving, but her
mouth and throat are beginning to hurt so much she can’t eat. We picked
up all the soft foods we could think of at the store. She sipped down
some refried beans mixed with cheese and milk, some chocolate ice cream,
and some chicken noodle soup. By the end, she was used enough to the
pain to eat her blueberries.</p>
<p>Ashley, her nurse today, told us that if her ANC goes down too far,
she’ll have to forgo fresh fruits and vegetables. Sigh.</p>
<p>Her multivitamin finally came in—it has to be ordered through the
hospital pharmacy so they know exactly what’s going into her.</p>
<p>She’s resting right now. We plan to make her get up after a half hour
and get into the wheelchair; if she doesn’t sit up enough, she can
contract pneumonia, which her body cannot fight off. We want to take her
outside again; today it’s crisp and clear and vivid blue, a perfect
autumn day. Also on the list are brushing her teeth, doing her leg and
arm exercises, and getting dressed.</p>
<p>No radiation or chemo today and tomorrow. We hope that means she’ll
feel good more hours of the day.</p>
<p>We brought in a hair clipper to shave her head. She’s been asking all
week, but her dad took his clipper back home last Sunday and it hasn’t
made it back up here.</p>
<p>Her current mood is sullen and fatalistic. She resents being pushed;
I keep reminding her why we’re pushing her, and indeed, why she’s doing
all this in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="visit-day-six-second-half">Visit Day Six (second half)</h2>
<h3 id="dec-2006-2">3 Dec 2006</h3>
<p>My daughter had another accident; we didn’t get her to the bedside
commode in time. I was helping her stand, and my pants got soaked.
Fortunately she and I are pretty much the same size; I borrowed a pair
of hers.</p>
<p>I gave her a sponge bath and got her dressed and into the wheelchair.
Her dad and stepmom came in just as we were starting to shave her head.
It looks surprisingly good on her. Right after, she started crying. It’s
good to see her let out some of her fear and sadness, though it breaks
my heart too.</p>
<p>We bundled her up in blankets and a hat and went outside. After
fifteen minutes we trundled her back inside, to the Corner Café. She
ordered macaroni and cheese and a bagel. We went back up to her floor
and sat in the open play area to eat. She’s getting used to the pain in
her mouth; she was able to down several bites of the macaroni, and she
ate some of the stuffed pasta shells on her dinner tray.</p>
<p>It seems to be a definite pattern: mornings are very difficult and
her mood is poor; afternoons are better, and she’s pleasant if not
upbeat. (And frankly, what’s there to be upbeat about?)</p>
<p>She’ll be getting fluconazole, an anti-fungal, from now on.</p>
<p>We did her leg and arm exercises, but didn’t brush her teeth.</p>
<p>She and I lay in bed together listening to her relaxation CD (Enya’s
<em>Watermark</em>).</p>
<p>Nausea suddenly hit her hard at 7:30 PM. Harder than before, because
she raised the head of her bed and asked for a towel to put in the
bucket to keep it from splashing. I asked Ashley to go ahead and give
her her bedtime dose of Ativan (it also helps nausea, and she’d had all
the Zofran she could have for a few more hours).</p>
<p>I couldn’t help crying as I watched her, hairless, slumped into a
green puke bucket, miserable. This is not the way it’s supposed to
be.</p>
<p>It’s just the way it is.</p>
