# Welcome to Awesome Site

## a collection of awesome pages

I have written all these awesome pages in order to test my awesome site-generating script. This part here is the intro text on my awesome home page. It could do stuff like link to other pages if I wanted to, or include an image or some audio. Like this:

![what a great image](great-image.png)

Of course, I also want to stick in a table of contents. Like this:

<!--TOC-->

I suppose I could have some text below that, too, if I really wanted to, though that seems kind of silly.
