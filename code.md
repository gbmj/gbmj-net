### Recent

- [Dill Thief](DOMAIN_URL_PHdill-thief/) is a gentle browser game where you use light to dispel the darkness.
<!-- note, maybe make this a subdomain later, with its own css etc.-->

### Ancient
- Last century I got paid to port and parallelize things in various flavors of assembly: the G.729A audio compression codec for IBM's Mwave, the OpenGL 3D graphics API for [BOPS' ManArray](https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/BOPS_ManArray_arch.pdf).
- Before that, in the mid-1990s, I added texture tiling to UNC's Pixel-Planes 5.  The codebase was in C and I had a whole 7 bits of system memory to work with. It was a pretty minor code tweak, but I was super worried I'd crash [the whole system](https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/MMRMassiveModelRenderingSystem.pdf). (I didn't.)
- Later, in the early 2000s, I wrote a few small PHP modules for osCommerce and its spinoff Zen Cart.
- Also in the early 2000s, I built a PHP engine to process natural language queries on a large company's website. This was before the chatbot explosion, and I designed it from scratch. At the time, it added some welcome interactivity and naturalness to the visitor's search for information, but it was a pretty simple program and in no way 'intelligent': much closer to ELIZA than to ChatGPT.
