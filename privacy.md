### No cookies, no tracking, no idea who you are 

Bonus: no screaming cookie popup :)

This site doesn't place cookies and doesn't collect visitor data of any kind, including metrics commonly used to analyze web traffic. Cloudflare (where this site is hosted) automatically provides rudimentary web analytics using a javascript beacon on each page. I've turned off this feature, so this beacon script is not installed. I don't embed third-party content, either. The site uses your system's fonts rather than calling the Google Fonts API, and if I ever need to show you a YouTube video, I'll link to the YT website instead of playing it directly in the page. You can decide whether you want to accept YouTube's cookies :).
