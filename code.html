<li><p><a href="https://github.com/gbmj/litesite">litesite</a> is a
simple static website generator written in Python. It was a great way to
dive in and start learning Python’s idioms. Back in the day I used PHP
to stitch together my website; this time I wanted to write something
others could also use, which forced me to think about how to leave
choices open, and how to write legible rather than minimal code. The
result no doubt violates the Zen of Python in many places, but it works
as intended and I had a lot of fun making it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gbmj.net/dill-thief.html">Dill Thief</a> will be a
gentle browser game where you use light to dispel the darkness. I’m
currently doing this one in Python, too, using pygame-ce and pygbag.
Fun!</p></li>

<li><p>In the last few years of the previous century I got paid to port
and parallelize things in various flavors of assembly: the G.729A audio
compression codec for IBM’s Mwave, the OpenGL 3D graphics API for <a
href="https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/BOPS_ManArray_arch.pdf">BOPS’
ManArray</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before that, in the mid-1990s, I added texture tiling to UNC’s
Pixel-Planes 5. The codebase was in C and I had a whole 7 bits of system
memory to work with. It was a pretty minor code tweak, but I was super
worried I’d crash <a
href="https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/MMRMassiveModelRenderingSystem.pdf">the
whole system</a>. (I didn’t.)</p></li>
<li><p>Later, in the mid-2000s, I wrote a few small PHP modules for
osCommerce and its spinoff Zen Cart. I’d started my own webshop and
wrote what I needed but couldn’t find: pdf invoices, iDeal payment
method, on-the-fly invoice numbering, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Also in the mid-2000s, I built a PHP engine to process natural
language queries on a large company’s website. This was before the
chatbot explosion, and I designed it from scratch. At the time, it added
some welcome interactivity and naturalness to the visitor’s search for
information, but it was a pretty simple program and in no way
‘intelligent’: much closer to ELIZA than to ChatGPT.</p></li>
