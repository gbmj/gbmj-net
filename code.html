<li><p>In the last few years of the previous century I got paid to port
and parallelize things in various flavors of assembly: the G.729A audio
compression codec for IBM’s Mwave, the OpenGL 3D graphics API for <a
href="https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/BOPS_ManArray_arch.pdf">BOPS’
ManArray</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before that, in the mid-1990s, I added texture tiling to UNC’s
Pixel-Planes 5. The codebase was in C and I had a whole 7 bits of system
memory to work with. It was a pretty minor code tweak, but I was super
worried I’d crash <a
href="https://github.com/gbmj/public/blob/main/MMRMassiveModelRenderingSystem.pdf">the
whole system</a>. (I didn’t.)</p></li>
<li><p>Later, in the mid-2000s, I wrote a few small PHP modules for
osCommerce and its spinoff Zen Cart. I’d started my own webshop and
wrote what I needed but couldn’t find: pdf invoices, iDeal payment
method, on-the-fly invoice numbering, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Also in the mid-2000s, I built a PHP engine to process natural
language queries on a large company’s website. This was before the
chatbot explosion, and I designed it from scratch. At the time, it added
some welcome interactivity and naturalness to the visitor’s search for
information, but it was a pretty simple program and in no way
‘intelligent’: much closer to ELIZA than to ChatGPT.</p></li>
