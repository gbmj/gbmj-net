<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="awesome">Awesome</h2>
<p>26 May 2007</p>
<p>That’s what my daughter said over and over when her dad and stepmom
called to tell her they’re coming over again on June 5—and bringing her
baby sister with them.</p>
<p>She was very sad her little sister didn’t come last time. And in the
past two weeks she’s mentioned four times that she doesn’t want to die
without seeing her father, stepmother, and sister again. We passed that
along to them, and they booked a flight!</p>
<p>It totally made her day.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="incontinence">Incontinence?</h2>
<p>27 May 2007</p>
<p>My daughter just wet her bed. It may be a fluke, or it may be a new
phase. We shall see.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="au-naturel">Au Naturel</h2>
<p>29 May 2007</p>
<p>We had several visitors today, among them our family doctor. Last
week Dr. Baars posed several intense questions; our daughter answered
them today. She wants minimal pain, even if it means she is less
wakeful. She does not want any interventions that postpone her death. If
she can no longer eat or drink, so be it; no IV fluids or tube
feeding.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="harry-potter">Harry Potter</h2>
<p>30 May 2007</p>
<p>Our friend Elise contacted the Dutch branch of the Make-A-Wish
Foundation on behalf of my daughter. Two very nice volunteers came
yesterday to get my daughter’s wish. Alas, it turns out she’s not
eligible since she already had a wish in the US. That sounds perfectly
reasonable to me, but it’s kind of a bummer. We’d thought up a wish that
we really can’t make happen ourselves.</p>
<p>My daughter has been an avid fan of Harry Potter since the first book
appeared in 1997. Harry Potter part 7 will be released on July 21, 2007.
It looks very unlikely that my daughter will be in a position to read it
then (if we could manage to be among the lucky crowd who gets a copy
right away). So she wished for a (supertopsecret and totally not shared
with anybody else) copy of the book now, with a dedication and signature
from J.K. Rowling herself.</p>
<p>Any miracle workers out there?</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="five-weeks-in">Five Weeks In</h2>
<p>1 Jun 2007</p>
<p>It’s been five weeks since my daughter woke with extreme confusion
and aphasia, indicating fluid buildup caused by tumor growth. It’s been
almost two weeks since her last MRI, which vividly illustrated just how
quickly the tumor’s growing.</p>
<p>This week, she’s been briefly dizzy from time to time. She twice
mentioned a slight difficulty breathing, both times while lying down.
She comments more frequently that she’s tired, though she’s not yet
sleeping during the day. She did cut a game of 10,000 short last night
around 8:30, however, so she could go to bed. That’s pretty shocking:
her grandparents and best friend Charlotte were here and it was a lively
6-person game. She’d have been in heaven if she hadn’t been so
tired.</p>
<p>She has discovered tomato Cup-A-Soup and eats it at least four times
a day.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="prehistoric-cookies">Prehistoric
Cookies</h2>
<p>3 Jun 2007</p>
<p>We visited the Eindhoven Historic Open-Air Museum today. There were
lots of kid activities in the prehistoric village: slamming rough-hewn
wood blocks through round holes to shape them for building pins,
grinding wheat to bake grain-and-water cookies, gliding over the water
in a hollowed-out tree trunk canoe.</p>
<p><img src="prehistoric-1.jpg" alt="prehistoric-1" /> <img
src="prehistoric-2.jpg" alt="prehistoric-2" /></p>
<p>There was also a passel of young ducks under the care of a mother
goose.</p>

<p>We’re not sure what crime they committed, but the kids ended up
having to do some hard time in the medieval village.</p>

<h4 id="recent-events">Recent Events</h4>
<p>Last Sunday we did Dutch gourmet (say “gore-MET”; think grilling all
kinds of meats and vegetables in tiny little pans at the table).</p>
<p>Last Wednesday the girls made cheese twists. Quite tasty, and fun to
make.</p>

<p>Last Thursday the youngest two participated in the school sponsor run
to raise money for new playground equipment. We had a respectable
cheering section with Oma, Opa, and Charlotte in tow.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="a-few-hours-extra-wait">A Few Hours’ Extra
Wait</h2>
<p>5 Jun 2007</p>
<p>My daughter’s father, stepmother, and baby sister have arrived in
Eindhoven. Alas, the original plan for us to drop her off at their hotel
at 2:00 PM has been changed to a dinnertime date. They’re tired and the
one-year-old is cranky, not having slept on the plane.</p>
<p>We’ve agreed to drop off and pick up our daughter each day at their
hotel so they are spared the hassle of bussing it with a toddler. The
total visit will be short; they are saying goodbye on Saturday, which we
recently discovered means they are spending the weekend close to the
airport (at Charlotte’s home, in fact) and doing some sightseeing in
Amsterdam on Sunday before flying out Monday morning.</p>
<p>Let’s hope it’s a good visit, filled with quality time together. Our
daughter has so been looking forward to it. It’s most probably the last
time they’ll see each other.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="morbid-humor">Morbid Humor</h2>
<p>5 Jun 2007</p>
<p>My daughter and I have had some good belly laughs lately at the
expense of her prognosis.</p>
<p>Her: Ooooh, I want an ice cream.</p>
<p>Me: But we’ve just had a lot of junk food. No ice cream.</p>
<p>Her: But it’s a perfect day for ice cream.</p>
<p>Me: Nope.</p>
<p>Her: Just a little one? A teensy weensy little ice cream?</p>
<p>Me: No way José.</p>
<p>Her (mock tragic): But I’m dying.</p>
<p>Me: And if you keep whining about ice cream, you may just die a
little sooner.</p>
<hr />
<p>Her (about her midday pills): Hey, are you trying to kill me with
this stuff?</p>
<p>Me: Yep. And it seems to be working pretty well.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="fuse-bead-frenzy">Fuse Bead Frenzy</h2>
<p>6 Jun 2007</p>
<figure>
<img src="fuse-beads.jpg" alt="fuse beads" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">fuse beads</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are 41 fuse bead creations in this photo; my daughter’s made a
few more that she’s given away.</p>
<p>My husband and I, ever the number crunchers, worked out what this
means in time spent.</p>
<p>There are roughly 400 beads per design (large squares have
approximately 800; small squares have approximately 200). My daughter
places one bead roughly every 5 seconds.</p>
<pre><code>45 creations * 400 beads / creation = 18,000 beads
18,000 beads * 5 seconds / bead = 90,000 seconds
90,000 seconds = 25 hours</code></pre>
<p>So my daughter’s spent 25 hours making fuse bead designs. She’d have
made many more, I suspect, if her mother would iron the darn things at
any kind of reasonable pace: she runs out of bead boards and has to wait
on me. And I do so love ironing.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="no-harry-yet">No Harry Yet</h2>
<p>6 Jun 2007</p>
<p>Several people have gone all out to help us get Meg a copy of the
seventh and last Harry Potter book before its release on July 21 (and a
very massive thanks to all of you). At least two have contacted the
publisher, Bloomsbury, and been gently turned down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tragically, we are receiving many requests like yours from around the
world and unfortunately there is nothing we can do to help. There is no
way that we can get books before July 21 st. The books have to be made
available to everybody at the same time so as not to spoil the
excitement for children and fans all over the world. I’m sorry we can’t
help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I completely understand this. How many English-speaking
children of Harry-Potter-reading age have a life-threatening illness
right now? One source estimates that one child per 1,000 is living with
a life-threatening illness. That’s roughly 60,000 children in the US
alone, perhaps half of whom are avidly awaiting the next Harry Potter
book. Add in children in England, Australia, and Canada, and you’ve got
a potential demand for special treatment that just can’t be met.</p>
<p>Even if my daughter were the only one requesting an early copy, I
understand why they won’t send her one. We’ll sign NDA and indemnity
forms out the wazoo promising not to reveal the plot, but that doesn’t
mean it won’t leak out. The publisher, being in the business of
maximizing book sales, can’t take that chance, and we can’t adequately
guarantee it won’t happen: we’d have to ban all visitors and lock the
book in a vault. I imagine we might still be beseiged round the clock
with unwelcome company trying to wheedle, sneak, or otherwise worm its
way in and get a look at that book.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that my daughter will likely be gone before July
21. This is the very last Harry Potter book; there’s something
comforting about her getting to read it before she dies, getting to
complete her journey alongside Harry. She’s one of the kids J.K. Rowling
writes about on her website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want the readers who have, in many instances, grown up with Harry,
to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing
where they are going . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote gets me misty-eyed for purely personal reasons; it will be
the last adventure my daughter will share with Harry (if indeed she gets
to share it with him) because she’s dying.</p>
<p>Let’s not give up yet; who knows what might be possible. As the
proverb (nearly) goes, many roads lead to Rome.</p>
