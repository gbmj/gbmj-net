MRI images are flipped, meaning what you see on the left is actually on the right side of the brain and vice versa. We selected these images as carefully as we could, but they aren’t shots of exactly the same location in exactly the same position. Moreover, the images were taken on different equipment using different contrast fluids, which is why the tumor seems brighter on one image than on another. Last but not least, reading MRI images is an art and a science; we hope these images are helpful to you on your journey, but please don’t use them to draw conclusions about your own MRIs.

You can see the large solid mass at the top right (top left in the image) and the smeary area in the left hemisphere (right in the image). This smear is what made Sophie’s tumor inoperable; it’s like a ribbon around her neural pathways. You can’t see it in this image, but the top right mass and the left smear are connected.
