<p>MRI images are flipped, meaning what you see on the left is actually
on the right side of the brain and vice versa. We selected these images
as carefully as we could, but they aren’t shots of exactly the same
location in exactly the same position. Moreover, the images were taken
on different equipment using different contrast fluids, which is why the
tumor seems brighter on one image than on another. Last but not least,
reading MRI images is an art and a science; we hope these images are
helpful to you on your journey, but please don’t use them to draw
conclusions about your own MRIs. You can click on each image for a
larger view.</p>

<p>These images demonstrate the positive effect Meghan’s six weeks of
radiation and vincristine-cisplatin had on the top right tumor:</p>

and vincristine-cisplatin

<p>These images demonstrate that the rest of the tumor hasn’t seemed to
notice there’s been treatment going on:</p>

<strong>(r) 27 Feb 2007</strong>: 1.5 months after the end of radiation
and vincristine-cisplatin. The dark center in the left tumor area
indicates necrosis (dead tissue), which could be from radiation; it’s
also a hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): a GBM grows so quickly
its blood supply can’t keep up with it, and the center dies off.

<p>From there, it only gets worse:</p>

image, 1.5 months after the end of radiation and
vincristine-cisplatin.<br />
<strong>(m) 10 Apr 2007</strong>: 1.5 months later, the top tumor is
stable, but the central one is growing, and now it’s crossed the midline
(arrow).<br />
<strong>(r) 21 May 2007</strong>: Another 1.5 months later. The second
round of treatment started on 23 April, stopped on May 4 due to low
blood counts.

<p>These series of images show changes to the tumor in the left
hemisphere between August 10 (top series) and September 18 (bottom
series), 2006. Each series starts at the midline in the brain (the
dividing line between left and right hemispheres) and proceeds out
toward Sadie’s left ear. Note that the August 10 scans begin slightly
closer to the midline (you can see Sadie’s spinal cord in the first
image) than the September 18 scans. This means each August 10 image
comes “before” (closer to the midline than) its corresponding September
18 image.</p>
