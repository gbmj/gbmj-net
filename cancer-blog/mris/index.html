<p>MRI images are flipped, meaning what you see on the left is actually
on the right side of the brain and vice versa. I selected these images
as carefully as I could, but they aren’t shots of exactly the same
location in exactly the same position. Moreover, the images were taken
on different equipment using different contrast fluids, which is why the
tumor seems brighter on one image than on another. Last but not least,
reading MRIs is an art and a science; I took my descriptions from what
the radiologist said, not what I saw myself. I hope these images are
helpful to you, but please don’t use them to draw conclusions about your
own MRIs.</p>
</details>
<p>These images show the positive effect Meghan’s six weeks of radiation
and vincristine-cisplatin had on the top right tumor (left in the
image):</p>

and vincristine-cisplatin

<p>These images show that the rest of the tumor hadn’t seemed to notice
there’d been treatment going on:</p>

<strong>(l) 27 Oct 2006</strong>: a month after her first MRI, before
the biopsy, 3 weeks before treatment began<br />
<strong>(r) 27 Feb 2007</strong>: 1.5 months after the end of radiation
and vincristine-cisplatin. The dark center in the tumor is necrosis
(dead tissue), which could be from radiation; it’s also a hallmark of
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): a GBM grows so quickly its blood supply
can’t keep up with it, and the center dies off.

</figure>
<p>From there, it only got worse:</p>

<figcaption>
<strong>(l) 10 Apr 2007</strong>: another 1.5 months later, the top
tumor was stable, but the central one was growing, and it had crossed
the midline (arrow).<br />
<strong>(r) 21 May 2007</strong>: Another 1.5 months later; the growth
was dramatic.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The images below are another view on the growth you see above. The
top series is from 10 April 2007; the bottom from 21 May. Each series
starts at the midline in the brain (the dividing line between left and
right hemispheres) and proceeds out toward Meghan’s left ear. Note that
the April scans begin slightly closer to the midline (you can see
Meghan’s spinal cord in the first image). This means each April image
comes “before” (closer to the midline than) its corresponding May
image.</p>

<p>On 29 Aug 2007 Meghan had another MRI scan, after three relatively
stable months. The existing tumor sites hadn’t changed since the May
MRI, but there was a new kid in town: a 1.5-cm lesion on Sadie’s medulla
oblongata.</p>

had spread into the brain stem (arrow).
