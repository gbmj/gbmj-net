<p>MRI images are flipped, meaning what you see on the left is actually
on the right side of the brain and vice versa. We selected these images
as carefully as we could, but they aren’t shots of exactly the same
location in exactly the same position. Moreover, the images were taken
on different equipment using different contrast fluids, which is why the
tumor seems brighter on one image than on another. Last but not least,
reading MRI images is an art and a science; we hope these images are
helpful to you on your journey, but please don’t use them to draw
conclusions about your own MRIs. You can click on each image for a
larger view.</p>

Sadie’s first MRI. You can see the large solid mass at the top right
(top left in the image) and the smeary area in the left hemisphere
(right in the image). This smear is what made Sophie’s tumor inoperable;
it’s like a ribbon around her neural pathways. You can’t see it in this
image, but the top right mass and the left smear are connected.</p>
