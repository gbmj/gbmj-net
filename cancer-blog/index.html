<blockquote>
<p>My eldest child has a brain tumor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those were the first words of my second-ever blog post back in 2006.
I’d started the blog as a place to store ideas and random musings, but
it soon became The Cancer Blog, read by friends and family and very many
strangers around the globe. It ended up a treasure trove of blow-by-blow
reporting I’ve been grateful to have ever since.</p>
<p>After my daughter died, I eventually took the blog down; I created an
anonymized site, <em>Sadie’s Brain Tumor</em>, to share the medical
details. But I think it’s precisely the personal that helped me when we
were in the thick of things. I felt less alone because other people
shared not just their MRIs and symptoms, but their days and nights and
grief. If you’re going through someone’s cancer, I hope this journal
helps you feel less alone, too.</p>
<p>Her name was actually Meghan, by the way.</p>
