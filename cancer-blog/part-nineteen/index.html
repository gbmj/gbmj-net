<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="not-the-best-night-ever">Not the Best Night
Ever</h2>
<p>28 Sep 2007</p>
<p>Yesterday seemed to be a better day for my daughter. She was
downstairs for about two hours in the afternoon and at dinnertime, and
Opa came up and played games with her for a while before dinner. She
drank a glass of chocolate milk around 1:30 PM, downed some chips and
salsa around 4 PM, and ate several bites of chili and rice at dinner.
That’s more than she’s eaten in days.</p>
<p>The chili and rice came back up in stages throughout the night. The
Zofran honeymoon seems to be over.</p>
<p>She had Zofran at 6 PM: five hours of relief, three hours too soon
for another dose at 11 PM. After the 12 AM upchuck, I gave her more
Zofran anyway. That got us to 3 AM: far, far too soon for another dose.
So we gave her dexamethasone. It seems to have worked; no more vomiting
so far (at 10 AM). I just gave her more Zofran and dexamethasone, and
I’m hoping the double whammy will do the trick till this afternoon, when
she can have more.</p>
<p>I was curious why the Zofran is helping her nausea, since it’s not
stomach-related but medulla-oblongata related (where her new tumor is).
This is what I discovered at Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ondansetron (INN) (IPA: [ɒnˈdænsɛˌtrɒn]) is a serotonin 5-HT3
receptor antagonist used mainly to treat nausea and vomiting following
chemotherapy. Its effects are thought to be on both peripheral and
central nerves. One part is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve,
which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla
oblongata, the other is a blockage of serotonin receptors in the
chemoreceptor trigger zone.</p>
<p>The clinical effect of ondansetron (and other drugs from the same
group) can be potentiated by combining it with dexamethasone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My plan is to giver her Zofran and dexa together three times a day
(that’s her prescription for each, though she’d recently eased back to
twice a day on the dexa). When that stops working, I guess we’ll up the
frequency to four times a day, assuming her doctor gives the okay.
Zofran is meant for short-term use (five days), though I haven’t found
any information on adverse affects related to long-term use. And
frankly, unless “long term” means “more than two weeks,” I’m not sure we
should be concerned about long-term effects.</p>
<p>After reading about the vagus nerve, I think I’m actually glad all
we’ve got is vomiting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vagus nerve supplies motor parasympathetic fibers to all the
organs except the suprarenal (adrenal) glands, from the neck down to the
second segment of the transverse colon. The vagus also controls a few
skeletal muscles, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Levator veli palatini muscle</li>
<li>Salpingopharyngeus muscle</li>
<li>Palatoglossus muscle</li>
<li>Palatopharyngeus muscle</li>
<li>Superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors</li>
<li>Muscles of the larynx (speech).</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the vagus nerve is responsible for such varied tasks
as heart rate, gastrointestinal peristalsis, sweating, and quite a few
muscle movements in the mouth, including speech (via the recurrent
laryngeal nerve) and keeping the larynx open for breathing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This probably explains why her speech is so hard to understand now,
and why she often chokes while swallowing. I really, really, really hope
she isn’t going to start having trouble breathing.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="slow-and-steady">Slow and Steady</h2>
<p>30 Sep 2007</p>
<p>The Zofran-dexamethasone double whammy seems to be working well, if
not ideally. It’s keeping the vomiting away, but my daughter still feels
nauseated in waves throughout the day.</p>
<p>I got excited when she woke at 6 AM for the first time all night—it’d
been 12 hours since her last Z-d dose. Twelve hours between doses would
be great (this isn’t candy she’s taking). My excitement was premature,
however; she threw up the pills right after she took them. In fact, she
probably woke because she had to throw up; she didn’t need to pee.</p>
<p>But that’s the first throwup since 3 AM Friday morning. And last
night she ate all her grilled cheese sandwich at dinner. Woo hoo!</p>
<p>We’ve ramped up the home health care. Starting tomorrow, they’ll be
coming three days a week to spend 3 hours with her, playing games or
otherwise interacting, plus two days to wash her. (I’ll keep doing the
“bottom wash” in between.) Most wonderfully, they’ll be coming three
nights a week for the whole night, 11 PM to 7 AM. And we can add in the
other nights whenever we decide we need to.</p>
<p>In less happy news, our insurance company decided the nearly € 15,000
bill from the hospital (so far) was ours to pay because the start date
(coinciding with my and my husband’s first visit with Dr. Gidding,
before my daughter arrived in NL) was before the start date of my
daughter’s insurance coverage. I’m sure we’ll work it out; the hospital
just needs to break down the charges according to dates instead of
lump-summing them. But what a shock.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="overnight-help">Overnight Help</h2>
<p>2 Oct 2007</p>
<p>We had our first overnight home health care visit last night. Sonja
came at 11 PM and stayed until 7 AM, handling medications and everything
else during the night. Being the first time, I of course had trouble
sleeping, but my husband slept wonderfully—great news, since he bears
the brunt of the nighttime wakings.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="argh">Argh</h2>
<p>3 Oct 2007</p>
<p>My daughter threw up at 3:30 AM, just 3.5 hours after her last
Zofran-dexa dose. Sigh. Dinner’s spaghetti, half digested, came back up.
It’s pretty disheartening to see her finally getting some food in only
to watch it be ejected hours later.</p>
<p>This was the first “breakthrough” vomiting we’ve had in several days,
though there’s been a funky pattern going on: Friday, Sunday, and
Tuesday mornings she threw up at about 6 AM. I’m beginning to wonder if
the Zofran and dexa really have all that much to do with when and why
she throws up.</p>
<p>Melanie and Jolanda (say “Yolonda”) from home health care were here
yesterday and today, respectively, for three hours in the mornings. They
gave my daughter a quick washing and played Sorry with her. Yesterday,
she slept most of the afternoon and came down for an hour or so at
dinner; she seems to be following the same pattern today. On a positive
note, she’s been eating dinner with us the past several nights, albeit
less than she used to eat.</p>
<p>I estimate she’s awake no more than 5 or 6 hours a day now.</p>
<p>This morning she refused her Zofran and dexa when I woke her for it
at 8:30 AM, even after I reminded her what it was for. She refused again
at 9:15 AM. At 9:40 she was ready to take it—whew. Refusing medications
is something the brain hospice site lists waaaaay late in the game.</p>
<p>Jolanda will be back for night duty at 11 PM. I’m hoping to sleep
better this time around.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="poop">Poop!</h2>
<p>4 Oct 2007</p>
<p>After ten days without pooping, three days of Importal (Colace), and
a desperation Dulcolax left over from the US supply, my daughter finally
let it out this morning. I’m hoping that will help her feel better; the
brain hospice site says retaining bowel movements can also cause nausea
and vomiting. And that’s been ramping up again lately.</p>
<p>She threw up twice yesterday (at 3:30 AM and at 5:30 PM), then had a
quiet night. She didn’t call Jolanda (the home health care nurse) at
all. Jolanda left at 7:15 AM; my daughter threw up at 8:00 AM. I wish
she’d have her rocky nights when home health care is here. But I’m glad
she was able to sleep through the night (as was I).</p>
<p>She should have started her period again last Sunday, but there’s no
sign of it yet.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="an-anniversary-of-sorts">An Anniversary of
Sorts</h2>
<p>7 Oct 2007</p>
<p>Yesterday, October 6, marks the one-year anniversary of my daughter’s
first MRI. She’s made it over a year since then! I credit the radiation
and chemotherapy with all the extra good months she’s had.</p>
<p>She seems to get a little bit worse each day. Yesterday she came down
for brunch and I played a few games of Sorry with her. She drooled
constantly from the right side of her mouth; I hadn’t noticed before how
pronounced that’s become. She’s confused if you speak too quickly, and
sometimes confused if you don’t. All her movements have become slower.
She often doesn’t seem to grok what we ask her to do, such as “move your
right hand” when pushing her up to the table. She’s starting to get
confused on days of the week and times of day.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon she called me (via intercom) and said she was
feeling sad. We talked for quite a while about her illness, and that
she’s dying. She’s known since the end of May that she’s terminal, but
yesterday she seemed surprised when I said it. She asked how long she
had; a week, a month, a year? I said probably a few weeks, and again her
look of total surprise. I’m surprised to see that she apparently doesn’t
realize how much she’s declined recently.</p>
<p>We’re trying an experiment with the Zofran and dexa, as she continues
to throw up at random times once every day or two. We’re going to keep
giving dexa three times a day (9 mg total), but stop the Zofran for 24
hours. If nothing changes, we’ll keep to that schedule.</p>
<p>Edited to add: We gave up on that plan 16 hours in, after she threw
up three times in the space of a couple of hours. She’s back to Zofran
and dexa three times a day.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="mappa-mondo">Mappa Mondo</h2>
<p>9 Oct 2007</p>
<p>We took my daughter to the Mappa Mondo children’s hospice in Waalre
(just south of Eindhoven) yesterday. She’ll be there until Thursday
morning, when we’ll pick her up and bring her back home. Her dad and
stepmom flew in this morning to spend today and tomorrow with her.</p>
<p>The Mappa Mondo house is absolutely wonderful. Staff and volunteers
are friendly, gracious, efficient, and understanding. The house itself
is gorgeous: two merged and renovated turn-of-the-century houses right
on the market square in little Waalre, with ornate high ceilings and
here and there original mosaic floors and stained glass. The whole place
exudes a homey peace and tranquility. I wouldn’t mind staying there a
few days myself.</p>
<p>We arrived just before 2 PM yesterday. After a cup of coffee (and a
glass of orange soda) in one of the two living rooms, we took the
elevator upstairs to my daughter’s room. She settled into bed and we
unpacked her things, including some photos of her brother, sisters, and
Charlotte. She channel-surfed on the TV for a while; later, she watched
about 15 minutes of a Harry Potter DVD from home. Around 5:30 PM we
headed back downstairs for a delicious dinner cooked by Dorien and Bea,
this week’s volunteers. Mappa Mondo volunteers spend a full week at the
house, sleeping there from Friday to Friday, doing the laundry,
shopping, cooking, and cleaning, as well as engaging with the children
staying at the house. There are also several staff members around each
day, including at least one nurse 24/7.</p>
<p>With all the excitement, my daughter slept much less than usual, and
halfway through dinner she was nodding off. My husband and I helped her
get ready for bed and tucked her in, then tiptoed back downstairs for a
cup of coffee with nurse Annemiek, Dorien and Bea, and J, the mother of
a 16-month old who lives at the house. We stayed about an hour, and good
thing we did: my daughter threw up just before 9 PM. We helped Annemiek
change her sheets and get her settled back into bed. After another 20
minutes downstairs, we finally left; it was hard to go despite feeling
she’s in excellent hands.</p>
<p>The house, while connected, has two distinct living areas. One is for
up to four children who live at the house; the other, for up to four
children who come for a temporary stay. Right now there are five
children, my daughter plus four babies. We had the dining room on the
west side to ourselves, a thoughtful touch from the staff, who are aware
that noise and commotion bother my daughter.</p>
<p>The four babies at the house have various maladies, ranging from
being born much too early to various rare syndromes. My husband and I
were particularly moved by J and her little girl. Despite a healthy and
uneventful pregnancy, the baby was born 8 weeks early and has an
extremely rare chromosomal aberration. She has a breathing tube
(cannula) in her neck, does not see or hear well, and lags far behind
developmentally. She sleeps poorly and requires nearly constant
attention; while we were there, J suctioned her cannula several times.
Parents must follow an intensive training in order to take care of
babies with this kind of tube. Single, 21-year-old J took care of her
daughter all alone for the first year. I don’t know how she survived it.
Since April the baby has lived at the Mappa Mondo house; J spends three
days a week with her, finally getting some time for herself, to work or
go back to school. She deserves it. If you’re wondering what kind of
cause to donate to, consider giving to the Red Cross to fund more of
these homes.</p>
<p>J said you see all kinds of things in the Mappa Mondo house, things
that make you realize your problem is nothing. That’s exactly how I felt
watching her baby. There are worse things than losing a child after 15
years of normal life.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>15 Oct 2007</p>
<p>My daughter mostly enjoyed her stay at Mappa Mondo (the bed was
harder than hers at home, so she didn’t sleep as well). She gave it a
so-so (flat hand tilting back and forth) when we asked, but she was very
glad to see her dad and stepmom.</p>
<p>We brought her home Thursday afternoon. The trip upstairs to her room
was the last time she’s been out of her bed other than to use the potty
chair. She mostly doesn’t want to come downstairs; the two or three
times she’s said yes, she’s changed her mind before she was even sitting
up. She’s dizzy a lot, and position changes make her even dizzier. She’s
also very tired. And her ability to help push herself to standing is
disappearing. If it goes completely, we won’t be able to get her to the
potty chair; getting downstairs will require a stretcher and a second
strong pair of arms. At that point I doubt we’ll move her anymore; it’s
already quite hard on her.</p>
<p>We’ve increased her dexamethasone to 12 mg a day (from 9). It seems
to have possibly increased her appetite just a bit; she ate several
bites of food twice yesterday. It hasn’t had much effect otherwise. The
vomiting still seems to be really random; some days she throws up just
once, some days multiple times, apparently unrelated to the timing of
her Zofran and dexa doses. But the two drugs do seem to reduce the
frequency.</p>
<p>Saturday she peed in bed and didn’t notice. Since then no more
accidents, but starting Thursday she’s been having more and more
difficulty telling when she needs to pee, and actually peeing when she
feels she has to. This frustrates her, feeling like she has to go but
nothing coming out.</p>
<p>She’s developed a significant amount of mucus in her mouth and
throat; she sometimes talks with a wet rasp and often clears her throat.
When she brushes her teeth, strings of clear mucus span the gap from her
mouth to the toothbrush, like thick wet strands of spiderweb.</p>
<p>She’s having nonspecific pain, where she doesn’t feel good but can’t
point to what hurts. Surprisingly, she isn’t having headaches; it’s the
rest of her body that seems to ache. She winces when we move her to
change her clothes or help her get comfortable. Since Friday morning,
we’ve been giving her paracetamol (acetaminophen) suppositories; she
can’t get the pills down anymore. They seem to help somewhat with the
achiness. The next step will be morphine, either in skin patches or a
subcutaneous pump.</p>
<p>She and I have been playing about two games of Sorry each day; she’s
too tired for more. Sometimes when I suggest it, she doesn’t even want
to play. I’ve been massaging her legs, feet, and hands daily with a
yummy raspberry lotion. And, of course, scratching her back.</p>
