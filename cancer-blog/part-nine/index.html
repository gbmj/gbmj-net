<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="sleep-and-recovery">Sleep and Recovery</h2>
<p>14 Jan 2007</p>
<p>I slept about 30 of the first 48 hours I was home: awake for the
two-hour ride from the airport, a little quality time with my husband,
and meals. I guess I needed it, but I hadn’t expected it.</p>
<p>My daughter is doing well. She’s eating a little bit more each day
and feeling hungry, though nothing sounds good. Her vomiting has slowed
to a near stop. The increased dose of steriods is probably to thank for
both.</p>
<p>Her dad and stepmom have taken her out to shop and brought in an
art-major friend to do some painting. They’re playing lots of games, and
it sounds like everyone is settling in to this major change. That’s
great to hear.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="steady-improvement">Steady Improvement</h2>
<p>16 Jan 2007</p>
<p>My daughter continues to eat more each day: Monday she ate a record
1/2 cup of macaroni and cheese, 6 strawberries, 1/2 cup of black beans
and cheese, 1 cup of Chex mix, 1/8 cup of mashed potatoes, 1 ounce of
chicken, 1/2 cup of salad, a few slices of tomato, and 1/4 of an orange.
Not much for you or me, but an immense amount for her!</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="coming-soon">Coming Soon?</h2>
<p>24 Jan 2007</p>
<p>Yesterday was my daughter’s first post-treatment checkup. Her
platelet count is very low: 35 (150 is normal). The home-care nurse will
draw blood on Thursday, and if it’s still very low, my daughter will get
her fourth blood transfusion.</p>
<p>The nurse will also unhook her from her IV, to stimulate drinking. My
daughter’s been getting 100 mL of fluids per hour round the clock; it’s
no wonder she hasn’t been thirsty. Her doctor is hoping she can manage
without IV fluids now, given her low platelet count (affected thereby)
and her vastly increased appetite (a replacement therefor).</p>
<p>Alas, one of the common side effects of her treatment is difficulty
swallowing liquids. Solid food presents no problem, but different
muscles are used to swallow liquids and these have been damaged by
radiation. Interestingly, speech therapy may be able to help her
here.</p>
<p>She weighs 112.9 pounds, up from 111 on January 3.</p>
<p>She has PT on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, OT the other two
weekdays. They report it’s unlikely her right arm will improve much, but
her right leg is getting stronger; with very intense rehab, she may even
recover most of its function. That sounds marvelous!</p>
<p>At this rate, her doctor feels she’ll be ready to travel to Holland
at the end of February.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="slow-and-steady-wins-the-race">Slow and
Steady Wins the Race</h2>
<p>7 Feb 2007</p>
<p>My daughter continues to improve. Her platelet counts, though doubled
after last week’s transfusion, are still low (in the 60s to a normal of
150); she’ll probably have another one soon. Hopefully this one will be
a full-blood transfusion, as she had an unusual and alarming reaction to
the platelet-only version.</p>
<p>We should hear back on yesterday’s MRI in the next few days, but
we’ve been forewarned it won’t tell us much. Most probably it will look
worse, as the dead tumor tissue will show up more prominently.</p>
<p>She’s off the IV and back to eating normally, but liquids still vex
her. Milk seems to work best. Her voice is stronger, but still
quavery.</p>
<p>She works diligently with the therapist during her daily one-hour PT
sessions, but (true to form) utterly lacks any intrinsic drive to regain
the use of her right arm and leg. It requires present unpleasant effort
that she just can’t seem to connect to a future reward (one more than
worth the work, I might add—we’re not talking about getting dessert or a
puppy or a trip to Hawaii).</p>
<p>We meet with the oncologist in Nijmegen on February 28, in time to
plan rehab treatment and get a wheelchair before our daughter’s arrival
in the first half of March.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="first-contact">First Contact</h2>
<p>1 Mar 2007</p>
<p>We found the hospital in Nijmegen yesterday without a hitch (thanks,
TomTom). Dr. Gidding, St. Radboud’s pediatric brain-tumor specialist,
spent over an hour discussing my daughter’s file and answering our
questions. Afterward, a nurse gave us a thorough tour of the clinic.</p>
<p>Dr. Gidding told us some information we hadn’t heard before: the
long-term effects from radiation, including cognitive deficiencies,
hearing loss, and hormone imbalances, will increase during the next two
to five years. So much for my assessment after the end of treatment that
my daughter had escaped the worst side effects. Her father and
stepmother have remarked that her short-term memory continues to
decline. We mentioned this to Dr. Gidding, who said that’s unlikely to
be a long-term effect this early in the game; it probably stems from
another source, possibly continued tumor growth, but by no means
definitely.</p>
<p>We asked about prognosis and she said it’s impossible to put a number
on my daughter’s chances, particularly since no one knows exactly what
she has. She confirmed that we understood the nature of the tumor
(high-grade, aggressive, malignant) and the two probable types (a
high-grade glioma/gliomatosis, PNET). She said surgery is usually an
integral part of treatment for a PNET, which of course couldn’t be done
in my daughter’s case. She did not contradict me when I said everything
I’d read indicated that a gliomatosis is basically a death sentence.
Based on what Dr. Gidding has seen in my daughter’s file, she feels it’s
not a lost cause, but there is every reason to be concerned about her
chance of surviving.</p>
<p>We asked her what to expect from Tuesday’s MRI. She said that very
rarely you’ll see a PNET tumor shrink, which is great. Most of these
tumors don’t respond that positively to radiation, however, so what you
hope to see is that it hasn’t grown. What you usually actually do see is
a slight increase in size, which means nothing because it’s normally
just a radiation side effect. Only over a longer time span can you see
whether the tumor has been stopped in its tracks.</p>
<p>Dr. Gidding put to rest my fears that we were letting valuable
treatment time slip by with every week my daughter remains in the US.
Given her current (unusually) low platelet counts, my daughter is not
yet ready for further chemotherapy.</p>
<p>We’ll speak again in two weeks, after the team has met to discuss the
data (including the biopsy sample, which Dr. Gidding still needs to
receive, and Tuesday’s MRI). “The team” includes an oncologist, an
endocrinologist, a pathologist, a psychologist, a rehabilitation
therapist, a surgeon, and others I can’t remember.</p>
<p>I left feeling comforted: a new hospital wing, spacious and light,
and efficient, friendly, knowledgeable staff. I left feeling
overwhelmed: soon we’ll be back in the medical circuit, driving an hour
each way for regular consultations, labwork, outpatient treatments, and
scans. As my husband said on the way there, this is a route we’ll come
to know well. I left feeling miserable: there is a moment in every such
conversation when the oncologist and the nurse look at you with intense,
almost tangible, compassion, and that’s when you realize all over again
that you have a child who is probably going to die.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="fourteen-days-and-counting">Fourteen Days
and Counting</h2>
<p>21 Mar 2007</p>
<p>We have an arrival date! My daughter will be flying in on Wednesday,
April 4th.</p>
<p>It’ll be a long day for her. After 10-plus hours of travel, she
touches down at Schiphol Airport at 7:30 AM, which will feel like 1:30
AM to her. We’ll drive an hour and a half to get home (I expect several
breaks along the way). At 3:00 PM a city worker will arrive to gather
the documents for her residence permit and verify her identity. This
must happen the day she arrives, for she is not medically insured in
Holland until she’s registered with the city.</p>
<p>We’re joining a kruisvereniging (home nursing service) to gain access
to helpful services, among them wheelchair rental to tide us over until
she can be fitted for her own chair.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="five-days-and-counting">Five Days and
Counting</h2>
<p>30 Mar 2007</p>
<p>We picked up a wheelchair and a bedside commode for our daughter this
morning. What a breeze: drive over to the home-care shop, tell them what
you need, wait a few moments while they get it from the back, show your
driver’s license, sign a receipt, and take it home.</p>
<p>Free of charge, mind you.</p>
<p>No forms to fill in, no mandatory doctor’s referral, no hassle, no
waiting. We didn’t even have to join a home-nursing service first.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of socialized health care. Though it seems
counterintuitive, socialized medicine engenders less bureaucracy than
the American system. Over the past five years in Holland we’ve needed
social services several times, and every time we’ve gotten help right
away, free of charge, with minimal paperwork. This is how it should be
in a humane society. I’ve no complaints about my taxes.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="zero-days-and-still-counting">Zero Days…
and Still Counting</h2>
<p>4 Apr 2007</p>
<p>We hung balloons and streamers and a big “welcome home Meghan” banner
before driving up to Lisserbroek last evening. My husband’s parents live
fifteen minutes from Schiphol airport, very handy for meeting a 7 AM
flight. We all trundled off to bed full of anticipation.</p>
<p>The call came about 2 AM. After two delayed flights out of
Raleigh-Durham and a lot of schlepping back and forth between terminals
C and A, my daughter and her father had been sent home. They’re rebooked
on the same flight today; here’s hoping yesterday’s mess has been
resolved.</p>
<p>We’re back in Eindhoven, sans our son, who preferred to stay at his
grandparents’ for the day. (Our youngest had a much-anticipated birthday
party to attend.) We’ve rescheduled the city to come tomorrow afternoon
and filled in another absence request form for school. We’ll drive back
to Lisserbroek this evening.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="shes-heeeeeeeere">She’s Heeeeeeeere!</h2>
<p>6 Apr 2007</p>
<p>We met my daughter and her father in the arrival hall around 8 AM
Thursday. Two of the four boxes filled with her clothing and ‘stuff’
were awol; they’ll be delivered to our home this afternoon by Schiphol
personnel.</p>
<p>The 1.5-hour drive home went smoothly. She was awake for all of it
and in great spirits. We had lunch and began unpacking the two boxes
that made it in. My husband carried her up the stairs to her room on his
back; she was nervous about it beforehand, but it went without a hitch.
Around 2:30 PM, as I scratched her back, she drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>The woman from the city came just before three and took a peek at
her, then gathered the forms to register her as a city resident. We’ll
need to make a second appointment for the residence permit, but the city
registration is enough to add her to our insurance policy as of
today.</p>
<p>She woke at 5:30 PM and came back downstairs for dinner. By 7:30 she
was dragging; after a brief chat with the neighbors, who brought her a
small gift, she went back to bed. She woke twice to pee, but otherwise
slept soundly through the night. She woke at 7:30 AM, bright and
chipper, and had breakfast with her brother and sister before they went
off to school. Right now she’s playing cards with Oma and Opa.</p>
<p>She’s much stronger than when I last saw her. She can sit entirely
unaided and has regained significant control of her right arm (though
nowhere near enough to use it productively). I don’t see as much
progress in her right leg, but that’s where we hope rehab will step
in.</p>
<p>I was a little shocked by her appearance, and I think the others
(Oma, Opa, my husband, and her brother and sister) were too. The last
time I saw her, she hadn’t eaten in three weeks and was down to 110
pounds (50 kilos). Now she’s at 128 pounds (58 kilos) and her cheeks are
round as a chipmunk’s. My first thought was of all the photos of fat,
smiling, bald, chipmunk-cheeked children with brain tumors I’ve seen in
my travels across the Web in search of information. Between the steroids
and the blow to her thyroid, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland from
radiation, her metabolism is out of whack. On the upside, her hair just
might be growing back in; her head is covered in a fine, thin, pale
blond fuzz not yet a centimeter long.</p>
<p>We’ll spend most of Tuesday at the clinic in Nijmegen; she’ll have
another MRI and we’ll meet with the oncologist, neurologist, and
endocrinologist. Soon after, we should hear what the treatment plan is.
Likely she’ll have more chemotherapy.</p>
<p>It feels really good that she’s here.</p>
