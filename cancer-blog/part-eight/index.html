<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="christmas-visit-day-fourteen">Christmas
Visit Day Fourteen</h2>
<p>7 Jan 2007</p>
<p>I arrived at 1:30 PM. She was on the phone with Charlotte, her Dutch
best friend, and really <em>laughing</em>. It was wonderful to see.</p>
<p>I scratched her back and offered her food. She didn’t eat anything,
nor did she pee the whole time I was there. She’s getting IV liquids so
I’m not too worried about her dehydrating, but I’m holding my breath for
the day she gets her appetite back. With any luck, that will be sometime
this week.</p>
<p>She sat up for half an hour while we worked on the puzzle together.
She asked me to keep working on it when she lay back down. We watched
TV, lying together in her bed, for the last two hours or so I was
there.</p>
<p>I asked her about her poem, and whether Good Meghan or Bad Meghan had
written it. She said, “well, you see, I think it was both of them
together.” I asked her if it was about anyone in particular, someone
she’d been angry with at the time. I listed several people: her dad, her
stepmom, me, her stepfather, her grandmother, someone at school. She
said she didn’t know; she didn’t remember.</p>
<p>I asked her if Good Meghan, Bad Meghan, or both of them had
threatened to kill her brother and sister. She said, “That was Bad
Meghan.”</p>
<p>I asked her what kind of help she wanted with Bad Meghan. She
shrugged her shoulders and said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>All this took quite a while, interspersed with periods of silence as
I scratched her back and tidbits of conversation about other things.
Each time I brought it up again, I asked her if she minded my asking
some more about Good and Bad Meghan. She always said no, she didn’t
mind. I think that’s a good sign: she can tolerate this, and seems to
even welcome it.</p>
<p>We talked about her moving to the Netherlands. She thought that would
be okay. She asked if she could go to an English school this time. I
asked her if school had been the thing she disliked most before. She
said yes. I told her we would look into the English school. She asked
about her old room on the third floor. I told her she’d have a new room,
on the second floor, and explained how we’d probably move things around
to turn one of those rooms into her bedroom. She liked that; in fact,
she wanted to keep talking about how things would be.</p>
<p>I could have said a lot of things I didn’t say: that she’d be seeing
Mokkie, the psychologist, again, and getting quite a bit of therapeutic
help. That she’d eventually be in a long-term therapeutic program,
probably residential, at least part-time. That school wasn’t much of a
worry right now, while she’s still battling cancer. I don’t think any of
those would have moved the conversation forward.</p>
<p>She spent most of the time I was there asking for the puke bucket,
but she never did puke. Her nausea came and went repeatedly. At one
point she said, “I really hate this not being able to eat.” Wow: I
didn’t know she felt like she couldn’t eat. I thought she didn’t eat
because she just wasn’t hungry. Apparently she feels her lack of hunger
(and maybe her throwing up) <em>prevents</em> her from eating. I take
this to mean she does understand that it’s important for her to eat.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="christmas-visit-day-fifteen">Christmas
Visit Day Fifteen</h2>
<p>8 Jan 2007</p>
<p>Today was much like yesterday. She was neither ebullient nor
downcast. I did see a few smiles.</p>
<p>She was most upbeat during the several games of mancala we
played.</p>
<p>She’s no longer receiving much in the way of IV fluids, and she peed
very little today; what did come out was a caramel color. She was
resistant to drinking much at all, and as usual she ate nothing.</p>
<p>Her dad and stepmom came in this evening, baby sister in tow (what a
cutie pie). Stepmom got another ounce or so of water into her, which she
promptly threw up. Her vomit contained more liquid than had just gone
into her. It also had the consistency of egg drop soup, but slightly
greener.</p>
<p>I don’t see how they can possibly release her from the hospital in
this condition.</p>
<p>We paged the attending physician and asked her to restart our
daughter’s IV liquids round the clock and to insert a feeding tube. The
IV is already pumping; she’ll discuss the tube with Dr. Blatt, our
daughter’s doctor while Dr. Gold is out of town, and I hope tomorrow
morning they’ll insert it. Our daughter’s barely eaten in over two
weeks; we can’t wait any longer for her appetite to come back. We need
to get her a few steps further from death’s door before she goes to
Rehab, or her dad’s, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Of course, that means tomorrow will be a fairly unpleasant day.</p>
<p>It’s been 13 days since her last spinal radiation, so the
gastrointestinal side effects from that should be gone by now. The
attending thought her nausea should already be lessening and her
appetite should be coming back given her last chemo was Friday, but she
said we should defer to Dr. Blatt’s expertise on that.</p>
<p>I hope my daughter will be moving in the right direction by the time
I leave this Friday.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="christmas-visit-day-sixteen">Christmas
Visit Day Sixteen</h2>
<p>9 Jan 2007</p>
<p>Dr. Blatt came by this afternoon and explained that she understands
why I’m worried as a mother, but my daughter’s condition is really not
that bad. They see this all the time, and she’s in pretty good shape.
Her appetite will come back within a week or so. There’s no need for a
feeding tube at this point, and chances are she wouldn’t tolerate it
well anyway.</p>
<p>They’ll be discharging her on Thursday. Chris, the social worker, has
spoken with Wake Rehab and they haven’t said “no” yet, but they do know
they won’t have space for her this week. So she’ll be going to her dad
and stepmom’s house until she either gets into Rehab, or flies back to
us.</p>
<p>One of the Hem-Onc nurses may be flying to the Netherlands in the
next few weeks, so they’re checking into having her fly with my
daughter.</p>
<p>My daughter ate five bites of pasta today. She peed a reasonable
amount, caramel-colored in the morning and a lovely pale straw color by
evening. That, at least, is going well.</p>
<p>I’m worn out. This is perhaps the shortest post I’ve yet made, but
I’m sure the reader understands.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="christmas-visit-day-seventeen">Christmas
Visit Day Seventeen</h2>
<p>10 Jan 2007</p>
<p>I thought it was a pretty good day on most points.</p>
<p>I really pushed my daughter to move herself. I helped her sit up and
to get to the commode, and I helped her back to sitting on the edge of
the bed. But from there, I told her she was on her own: if she wanted to
lie down in bed, she needed to get herself there.</p>
<p>She did it four times, completely on her own. It took about 45
minutes each time, with me encouraging her, cheering her on, and
offering suggestions. But I didn’t move a finger to help her.</p>
<p>She complained bitterly about it. She asked me to please just HELP
her. I told her I was helping her. I gave her a pep talk, over and over,
about how much better she’ll feel a week from now, how much more energy
she’ll have, how much stronger she’ll be, and how much easier all this
moving around will become. I told her she’s over the top of the
mountain, and every day she’ll pick up speed as she coasts downward.
Every day it’ll be a little bit easier to move. Soon, she’ll be able to
whip herself over and up and back without giving it much thought at
all.</p>
<p>She was mad at me this afternoon. She complained to the psychiatrist,
Linda from PT, and the nurses about how I was “making her do stuff.” I
said, “You know why I’m doing this; tell me.” She scowled, “I don’t
know; why?” I told her she knew. Finally she said, “Because you love me
and you want me to get stronger.” Right on.</p>
<p>This didn’t make her any less mad at me, but at least it’s in
there.</p>
<p>She threw up four times, which alarms me slightly. I’d expect the
frequency to be going down, not up. I suppose it’s normal, but I’ll ask
the doctor about it tomorrow anyway. It may be from her medications on a
perennially empty stomach.</p>
<p>She had four or five sips of milk, one bite of peach, and one bite of
banana pudding. She took all her morning pills (late afternoon).</p>
<p>She had two pee accidents last night; she’s on IV fluids round the
clock, and this has tended to happen whenever she is. She pooped twice
today, good news since they’re holding the laxatives at present.</p>
<p>She got a DuoDerm patch at the base of her spine, to protect the skin
there. It’s starting to get red from all the friction of moving around
in bed. Her back is peeling like a hefty sunburn; her scalp is mostly
peeled out. I convinced her to let me smear on the vaseline-like lotion
the radiologists gave her.</p>
<p>She’ll go home to her dad’s tomorrow. All the equipment’s been
arranged, and her dad took a carload of cards, gifts, books, and other
paraphernalia home tonight. I think being out of the hospital will do
her good–help jumpstart her appetite and her verve.</p>
<p>It’s going to be quite intense for her dad and stepmom. She’ll be on
IV fluids and IV Zofran, her anti-nausea medicine. She’ll also have to
take several pills for at least a while: Synthroid to replace her
thyroid hormones, Septra to protect her from infection, and perhaps
others. She still needs a lot of assistance to move, she’s throwing up
at random times, and she can’t wipe her own butt when she poops. Today
the nurses changed her bed five times: twice for peeing, three times for
vomiting.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy for them. I hope the prospect that it has a definite
end will help them make it through.</p>
<p>I’ll go with my daughter when she leaves the hospital and spend the
afternoon at her dad’s, helping her and stepmom pack a suitcase to go
back with me and passing on any tricks I can to help ease the transition
for everyone. I’ll be back Friday morning for a few hours before I head
for the airport.</p>
<p>Rita and I stayed up far too late tonight talking. It was great, but
we’ll pay tomorrow!</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="christmas-visit-day-eighteen">Christmas
Visit Day Eighteen</h2>
<p>11 Jan 2007</p>
<p>She’s out of the hospital!</p>
<p>She was carried by wheelchair van to her dad’s house (I rode with
her) around 5 PM. Her dad and stepmom had a very busy day: receiving all
her medical equipment (bed, wheelchair, commode, IV system) and
prescriptions (Synthroid, Pepcid, Colase, Dolcolax, Decadron, Septra,
Prozac); practicing a sterile dressing change for her port-a-cath;
learning how to operate the IV machine; and, of course, shouldering the
immense responsibility for someone who needs IV fluids around the clock,
can’t move herself independently much at all, and is vomiting four times
a day. They’ll sleep much less soundly for the next several nights. I
don’t envy them; I do wish I could do more before I leave.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe I may have ridden the elevator from Five
Children’s to the lobby for the last time ever.</p>
<p>She was much better at moving herself into bed today, though she
steadfastly refused to acknowledge that. I don’t know if she just
doesn’t get it, or if she’s being stubborn. Either way, it took her half
as long to get herself back in as it did yesterday, and I saw
significant improvement in her right leg. Not that it’s moving well, but
she can twitch her quadriceps and pull her knee up a fraction of an inch
at a time.</p>
<p>I asked three doctors about her throwing up more frequently, and only
the last one (Dr. Blatt) said that that is indeed unusual. She
recommended upping my daughter’s dose of steroids from 2 to 8 mg per
day; they may have tapered her off too fast, which could contribute to
her stomach woes, and in any case the steroids should help her
appetite.</p>
<p>Let’s hope she stops throwing up and starts regaining her lust for
food within the next two or three days.</p>
<p>I’ll be flying home tomorrow; there may not be another blog post
until Sunday. Fear not, dear reader, no calamity has befallen our
beleaguered heroine; she merely suffers from a jetlagged mother.</p>
