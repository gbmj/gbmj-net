# Glioblastoma Journals

These are the stories I returned to over and over, following new updates or rereading old entires about symptoms, surgeries, chemo, radiation, MRIs .... 

- [Sandy Beardsley](https://sandybeardsley.com/) (1961&ndash;2006) kept a detailed journal of her seven-year battle with GBM; her husband blogged her final months. 

- [Danielle Drumke](http://danielledrumke.com/updates.html) (1973&ndash;2002) lived eighteen months after her GBM diagnosis. Her sister and others blogged the journey.

- [Krista Ralston Oakes](https://onkristasmind.blogspot.com/2005/11/seize-day.html) (1967&ndash;2010) died two days before her five-year GBM survival anniversary. Her husband Jared still maintains the blog; Krista's entries start with the linked post and end in December 2010.

- [Cheryl Broyles](https://cherylbroyles-gbm.com) (1967&ndash;2023) maintained a detailed website during her 23 years living with GBM. She didn't keep a blog, but her site is filled with articles, and she wrote a book about her experience eight years after her diagnosis.

- While not a personal blog, Diane Phillips' [Brain Hospice](https://www.brainhospice.org/) was an invaluable comfort and resource.
