<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="sweet-sixteen">Sweet Sixteen</h2>
<p>12 Sep 2007</p>
<p>Tuesday was one big party. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself and
gave her sixteenth birthday two big thumbs up. (And it’s not even over…
still a whirlwind trip to Spain to come!)</p>
<p>Many, many thanks to everyone in the US and the Netherlands who sent
cards and packages. (Check out the “wall of cards” below.) A special
thanks to Claudia for the beautiful scrapbook—she loves it.</p>

<p>Many came to congratulate her in person: family, friends, physical
therapist Lea, and wonderful Loe, who comes to play games with her twice
a week.</p>
<p>Eleven of us trooped out to Lister’s restaurant in Nuenen for dinner
at 6 PM, where my daughter ordered her first legal drink: a shot of
Bailey’s with dessert.</p>

<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="girona">Girona</h2>
<p>18 Sep 2007</p>
<p>It was an early day Saturday: my daughter rose at 7:00 AM (instead of
her usual 10:30 AM). A 10-minute car ride brought us to Eindhoven
Airport. Ryanair staff were ready for us with a fancy truck that lifted
my daughter, wheelchair and all, into the 737. The equipment was a
little less impressive in Girona, but no less comfortable; these two
gentlemen were very gentle with her.</p>

<p>From Girona Airport we took a 20-minute taxi ride to Hotel AC Palau
de Bellavista, which lived up to its name. After checking into our
luxurious rooms in uber-modern style, we headed out to the gigantic
terrace for a view of the city. Then it was a long, steep walk down the
hill (dare I say mountain) to the center of the old city, where we
admired the wares of a painter selling his watercolors of the city and
the Costa Brava.</p>
<p>Though he spoke no English, he was able to point our famished selves
across the river to the main plaza, teeming with sidewalk-terraced
restaurants. We ordered tapas (what else?).</p>
<p>A guitarist and saxofonist came out to play for the terrace diners.
My daughter was delighted by their serenade with the Spanish version of
“Happy Birthday.”</p>
<p>Along the way we discovered that Charlotte has her own jewelry
business.</p>

<p>After lunch, we continued north out of the plaza, stopping to admire
the sizable fish swimming in the river. Of the six bridges crossing the
river, only two are easily wheelchair-accessible; not the picturesque
one, alas.</p>
<p>We crossed at the next bridge down, where we spied a handful of
kittens napping in a drainage pipe.</p>
<p>Lots of walking down narrow streets in search of shops. In Spain,
they still practice siesta, and most shops close at 1 or 2 PM to reopen
at 4 or 5 PM. So it was window shopping for us the first hour.</p>
<p>Two shoe shops, one (very expensive) clothing store, a Nepalese shop,
a witchy shop featuring incense, garden gnomes, and wooden toys, a
handmade soap shop, a gift shop, a bookstore, a stop for smoothies, and,
of course, an ice cream parlor.</p>
<p>It was a long, tiring day for all of us, but especially so for my
daughter. It was hard to see that she seemed so confused at times. In
the ice cream parlor she was reduced to tears by something that wasn’t
right; it turns out she just wanted some napkins.</p>
<p>We saw remnants of art nouveau architecture here and there.</p>
<p>My husband and Charlotte dashed up the 88 steps to the Girona
cathedral. There was no wheelchair ramp, but my daughter didn’t seem to
mind missing the cultural monument up close.</p>
<p>Then it was a mad dash back down the hill and across the river to the
one restaurant in all Girona that has a wheelchair-accessible bathroom.
To show our gratitude (we used their restroom twice, the second time
during their pre-dinner closing), we waited the half hour until they
reopened for dinner at 8:30 PM. To pass the time, we ordered drinks at a
nearby cafe and experienced what is quite possibly the worst service in
Spain, if not the universe.</p>
<p>We’d just gotten our basket of bread at the restaurant when my
daughter, tired and feeling nauseated, said she just couldn’t make it
through dinner. We left € 15 for the bread, the bathroom, and the
inconvenience and caught a taxi back to the hotel. After two visits to
the bathroom she was feeling better; we ordered absolutely exorbitant
(and thankfully delicious) room service and ate dinner at 11 PM (which,
in Spain, is perfectly normal). Then it was off to bed with the enticing
lure of a lazy Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Being Spain, the breakfast bar was open until noon, and we ambled in
at 11 AM Sunday morning. We feasted on cured Iberian ham, various
breads, cereals, fresh fruits and fruit juices, yogurt, brownies,
muffins, and delicious café con leche, enjoying the view across the
terrace.</p>
<p>The weather couldn’t have been better both days, and we couldn’t
resist another half hour on the terrace.</p>
<p>We checked out at 12:45 PM and took a thoroughly eventful taxi ride
back to the airport. Our first taxi driver hit a bicyclist crossing a
pedestrian walkway. (Despite his tumble onto and back off the front
windshield of the taxi, the cyclist was limping but otherwise unharmed;
alas, his crate of glasses was pulverized.) We were already cutting it
close time-wise, but the second taxi driver got us to the airport with
time to spare.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>19 Sep 2007</p>
<p>My daughter threw up twice yesterday: once in the afternoon when she
went from lying to sitting, and once in the middle of the night after
she’d gone to the bathroom. This is probably from the new brain stem
tumor. We aren’t sure if it’s going to happen every day, or if this is a
relatively isolated incident (like the one two weeks ago, when she threw
up in the morning at Oma and Opa’s house).</p>
<p>Her speech has gotten worse. She often doesn’t pronounce words fully;
it sounds like she’s swallowing the words, or holding her breath when
she talks, sort of nasal and muffled at the same time.</p>
<p>She’s having increased difficulty standing. The decline started about
three weeks ago. Her upward curve in physical therapy (she was standing
with the walker and assistance for longer periods) took an abrupt
nosedive. Yesterday she suddenly became dead weight in my husband’s arms
while transferring to the toilet.</p>
<p>I think we made it to Spain just in time.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="how-cool-is-that">How Cool Is That?</h2>
<p>21 Sep 2007</p>
<p>In all the recent comings and goings I haven’t yet mentioned that J.
K. Rowling has been in contact with my daughter. Needless to say, the
first contact made my daughter’s day, if not week, month, and year.</p>
<p>A great big thanks and a thousand kisses go to our friend Robin,
whose frenzied attempts to get my daughter an advance copy of HP7 bore
this awesomely cool fruit.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>21 Sep 2007</p>
<p>The vomiting appears to be a new fixture. After the two episodes
Tuesday came two Thursday, then one this morning.</p>
<p>Also new is an abrupt change: my daughter spent the entire day
sleeping (save a couple of potty breaks and a sponge bath). We coaxed
her downstairs for dinner. In keeping with the last couple of weeks, she
ate a hearty dinner as nearly her only food of the day. In Girona, in
fact, she even threw away the last half of her ice cream cone.</p>
<p>The sponge baths also date to the last two weeks or so; her balance
is no longer good enough for the shower.</p>
<p>She no longer shows much interest in fuse beads and seems to be
slowing down on her reading as well. Lately she’s been watching animal
shows on the National Geographic and Discovery channels. She still looks
forward to and enjoys Loe’s biweekly visits to play games.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="weekend-away">Weekend Away</h2>
<p>22 Sep 2007</p>
<p>We were worried my daughter might be up all night, but she went to
bed at the usual time and slept through (one potty break, as usual).
We’re off to Oma and Opa’s this afternoon; friends are having a barbecue
and my daughter would be miserable there with all the kids running
around. She’ll stay with Oma and Opa while we’re at the barbecue; we’ll
all sleep in Lisserbroek and return home Sunday evening.</p>
<p>My daughter asked if she could stay at Oma and Opa’s longer, but
given the recent changes we’re afraid to chance it.</p>
<p>Edited to add: She just threw up again.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="farther-down-the-winding-path">Farther Down
the Winding Path</h2>
<p>25 Sep 2007</p>
<p>Today I spoke with Dr. Gidding about the recent changes. She
prescribed Zofran for the nausea and vomiting, which I picked up this
afternoon; the first dose is in. If the Zofran hasn’t helped by
tomorrow, we’ll increase her dexamethasone back up to 9 mg (she’s been
on 6 mg for the past three weeks).</p>
<p>Our family doctor came by at lunchtime to assess the situation and
discuss pain medications and other aids we may need soon. The consensus
is that we are (suddenly, it seems, after the months of stability) on
the downward slope; how quickly it will go, no one can say. He asked my
daughter again if she wanted a tube for feeding and hydration when she
can no longer eat and drink herself; again she said no. Dr. de Moel laid
it out in black and white for her: once she stops drinking, death will
occur within a week.</p>
<p>Yesterday she was out of bed for a total of 4 hours. Today she’s been
downstairs for 1.5 hours so far (it’s 5 PM), and she was awake and
talkative for an hour or so with Marianne, the home health care person
who came to bathe and dress her. Ingeborg, another home health care
nurse, will be coming tomorrow to stay with her while we visit the Mappa
Mondo house, a children’s hospice. We want to see what they have to
offer and what the place is like. The plan is still to keep her at home,
but we want to be prepared.</p>
<p>Today is the first time we’ve made use of home health care in quite a
while. My guess is we’ll be using them more and more from here on
out.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day she’s declined dinner. She eventually
came down and ate four bites of cereal. Today she’s had a small bowl of
vanilla ice cream (which went into the bucket half an hour later). She’s
still getting some water with her pills and in between, but it can’t be
more than a cup or two.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="a-little-zofran-relief">A Little Zofran
Relief</h2>
<p>27 Sep 2007</p>
<p>Much to my surprise and delight, the Zofran has helped my daughter’s
nausea. She was nausea- and vomit-free Tuesday evening and Wednesday.
Timing her third dose (she’s on 8 mg 3x/day) has been tricky; we’ve been
giving it when she gets up to pee, as long as there’ve been at least 7
hours since the last dose. Last night there’d been 10 hours, and that’s
too many. She promptly threw the Zofran pill back up. The second pill
threatened to be a loss, too: she spewed the water and pill out like a
whale (it was rather spectacular), getting both of us wet. Fortunately
we found the Zofran and it went down fine the third time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its magic may already be wearing off. She woke up four
hours after the last Zofran feeling slightly nauseated.</p>
<p>She was downstairs for one hour yesterday, at dinnertime. She ate
several bites of dinner and a small bowl of vla (pudding). Ingeborg from
home health care and Loe, her biweekly volunteer, both played games with
her up in her room.</p>
<p>She isn’t sleeping the entire time she’s in bed. Often if we peek in
(in older Dutch homes, doors have a glass panel above them), she’s
staring at her fingers or staring out in front of her. Yesterday she
said she was kind of bored, and I suggested several of her usual
pastimes: read, fuse beads, puzzles, TV. She didn’t want to do any of
them, nor did she want to come downstairs.</p>
<p>I asked her if she’d stopped reading because it’s gotten harder to
see the words; she said no. I asked her if it’s because the story is
hard to follow; she said yes.</p>
<p>Her urine is frequently tea-colored now. Not the usual dark yellow of
concentrated urine, but an almost amber color, golden orange bordering
on red. According to the brain hospice site, this is all part of the
process.</p>
<p>She woke and wanted to come downstairs early this morning to wish her
sister a happy birthday before school, but as soon as she was standing
she changed her mind. So the birthday girl came up to her.</p>
<p>She’s standing much more poorly than she was even a few days ago
(which was already quite poor; recently, it’s taken both of us to
stabilize her). The stairs may soon be a thing of the past, unless we’ve
got another burly man or two around to help carry her.</p>
