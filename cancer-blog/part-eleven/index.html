<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="somber">Somber</h2>
<p>17 Apr 2007</p>
<p>Last Tuesday’s MRI shows two things: the largest tumor area has
shrunk; the smeary areas have grown. This is not post-radiation swelling
or dead tissue. From the report (translated from the Dutch):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A comparative scan was taken elsewhere on October 27, 2006. The right
frontal extra-axial mass is no longer visible. There is however now a
visible lesion that extends from the right frontal area via the corpus
callosum to the left frontal area. The lesion shows nonuniform areas of
contrast enhancement with a nonenhanced center suggesting necrosis. The
lesion is heterogeneous and appears to consist of multiple foci. The
scan is radiologically very suggestive of a glioblastoma multiforme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doctor said we have 3 options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do nothing. We all know how that ends, likely within 3 months.</li>
<li>Palliative chemotherapy. This extends lifespan, but only by a few
months.</li>
<li>Very heavy chemotherapy. There is a small, but existent, chance this
will lead to a cure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our daughter and we chose option 3. She and I signed the consent
form. Her first treatment is next Monday, April 23.</p>
<h4 id="the-treatment-plan">The Treatment Plan</h4>
<p>There are two phases to treatment: the first contains 3 cycles; the
second, 8. Each cycle lasts 4 weeks. In the first phase she receives
cisplatinum through her port-a-cath (PAC) for 2 days in the hospital and
oral etoposide for 21 days at home. Then she has a 1-week break.</p>
<p>In the second phase she receives vincristine and cyclofosfamide
through her PAC: cyclofosfamide for two days per cycle, vincristine one
day every week for three weeks, then a 1-week break.</p>
<h4 id="complications">Complications</h4>
<p>There are several factors that will influence treatment trajectory.
First and foremost is whether she can handle it psychologically. Second
is her physical condition: her bone marrow may not be able to handle it.
She will be at risk for infections; she may develop high fever. She will
certainly be nauseated and throw up. Cisplatinum can affect kidney
function; cyclofosfamide can cause bleeding in the bladder. Both are
rare side effects and are not expected to occur. And it goes without
saying that she’ll be taking lots of medications to ward off infection
and protect against these side effects.</p>
<p>If her hemoglobin falls below 4.5, she’ll get a transfusion. If her
white blood cell count falls under 1, she’ll get a transfusion. If her
platelet count falls too low (“too low” is different for each person;
they gauge it by gum bleeding or nosebleeds that don’t stop), she’ll get
a transfusion. If anything falls too too low, including her absolute
neutrophil count (ANC; it must stay above 1), treatment will have to be
stopped.</p>
<h4 id="bloodwork">Bloodwork</h4>
<p>Last week’s bloodwork results:</p>
<pre><code>Hemoglobin 6.9 (normal is 12-16)
Hematocrit 0.32 (normal is 0.36-0.47)
Erythrocytes 3.06 (red blood cells; normal is 4-5)
Leukocytes 3.0 (white blood cells; normal is 4.5-11)
Thrombocytes 105 (platelets; normal is 150-400)
ANC 2.38 (normal)</code></pre>
<h4 id="lunesta-and-prozac">Lunesta and Prozac</h4>
<p>We’ve been given the OK to stop Prozac. Since she’s only taking 10mg
per day, she doesn’t need to ramp down first.</p>
<p>We can’t just stop taking the Lunesta, however. Zopiclone is
addictive in the manner of benzodiazopenes, the most famous of which is
Valium. And in fact she’ll be taking Valium to get her off the Lunesta
(not available in Europe) without withdrawal symptoms. Great. So much
for all the marketing blah blah that Lunesta isn’t habit-forming.</p>
<p>She’ll take 1 mg Valium for two days, then 0.5 mg for two to three
days, then stop.</p>
<h4 id="rehab">Rehab</h4>
<p>We’ve managed to reschedule our first rehab appointment to this
Thursday now that next Monday has been appropriated by chemotherapy. I’m
glad we could move it earlier and not later; once chemotherapy begins,
she’ll be in sorry shape for vigorous physical exertion.</p>
<p>I am severely disappointed that the original plans for intensive
rehab in the US didn’t go through. The past three months were the best
months she’ll have for at least a year. She might have been able to
regain considerably more functionality if she’d had intensive rehab
instead of one hour a day. She might be walking now. And there’s no
reason to expect that functionality to disappear again; who knows what
the tumor will press on next, if it in fact continues to grow.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="rapid-progress">Rapid Progress</h2>
<p>19 Apr 2007</p>
<p>Monday’s CIZ meeting has already produced results: we’ve been granted
14 to 19.8 hours of in-home help per week. I received the letter today;
not an hour after I read it, the home health-care service called to set
up an introductory home visit.</p>
<p>We met with the rehab doctor at Blixembosch today. That, too, has
already produced results: my daughter’s right leg has been cast for a
brace, the doctor has a meeting with the director of the associated
school, and we’ve got an in-home appointment with an ergotherapist to
advise us on a wheelchair and modifications to our home.</p>
<p>We also have a referral to an in-home physical therapist. Alas, with
the onset of more chemo, Blixembosch feels she won’t be up to intensive
rehab.</p>
<h4 id="the-leg-brace">The Leg Brace</h4>
<p>Because she hasn’t used her right leg for so long, her calf muscle
has shortened and she cannot at this point bring her foot to a neutral
position. This means that when she stands, her right knee bends
backward. The brace will keep this from worsening and allow her to stand
and (as she progresses) walk. As therapy helps to stretch her calf
muscle, the heel in the brace can be lowered (presumably by making a new
brace; I don’t know the details on this).</p>
<h4 id="the-school">The School</h4>
<p>My daughter has a HAVO-VWO recommendation from her Dutch school
years. The Mytyl school associated with the rehab center provides only
up to VMBO-t. We can either have her attend the Mytyl school anyway,
where she will be out of the house and around agemates part of the day
in an environment designed for children with a physical handicap, or
enroll her in a regular high school and through them request in-home
teaching at HAVO-VWO level.</p>
<p>Given the year she’s going to have, we prefer the Mytyl school.
VMBO-t is equivalent to American high school (VWO, by comparison, is
equivalent to American high school plus the first two years of college).
I see no need for her to work at the hardest possible level while she’s
battling cancer. A daily change of scenery and some new friends to help
provide distraction seem more important.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="never-a-dull-moment">Never a Dull
Moment</h2>
<p>20 Apr 2007</p>
<p>We had quite an eventful morning. The good news is that we’re already
making profitable use of the home health-care organization’s
service-on-demand feature: my daughter buckled and fell while we were
pivoting her back into the wheelchair from the toilet. Neither of us was
hurt, but I couldn’t get her back up off the floor. So I called Zuidzorg
and they sent a very nice caregiver to help us.</p>
<p>This is the second time she’s buckled on me in the bathroom; I think
it’s related to the slight step up from the bathroom to the hall. (A
Dutch half-bath is slightly more than one square meter, just large
enough for the toilet and your knees; there’s no getting a wheelchair
into it.) Once she navigates that hurdle, all she has to do is turn and
sit, but for her weakened right leg that 1-inch rise is quite a
challenge. And I’m just not strong enough to hold her upright if her
left leg buckles and she suddenly puts all her weight on me.</p>
<p>Until my husband returns, we’ll use the potty chair instead. We try
to limit the potty chair to middle-of-the-night use—we want her to feel
like a normal person, and a potty chair just screams “disabled”—but I
won’t risk another bathroom fall, even though 98% of the time we do just
fine.</p>
<hr />
<p>My daughter’s stepmother, a drug company rep for Lunesta, let us know
that at her dosage, my daughter shouldn’t experience any withdrawal
symptoms and thus we shouldn’t need to use Valium. Sounds good to me! We
halved my daughter’s last Lunesta pill and she took the second half last
night. Tonight she’ll sleep unaided for the first time in nearly six
months.</p>
<hr />
<p>The insurance circus is finally over. (Famous last words.) We’ve had
to take out a separate policy for her (a “buitenlandverzekering,” or
travel insurance, oddly enough; she’s rather the opposite of a Dutch
person traveling outside the Netherlands) until her residence permit is
finalized. Fortunately, our insurer is backdating the policy to April 5,
the day she arrived. It will cover all her major medical expenses in
Holland. For € 95 a month, that’s a deal. In fact, it’s already paid for
itself for the up to six months we’ll need it: her leg brace alone will
cost € 513.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Dutch law stipulates that a foreigner cannot be
covered under regular medical insurance until his or her residence
permit is approved (I looked it up). So our insurance company wasn’t
being difficult after all. In fact, I think it’s very generous of them
to offer us the interim policy, knowing it will cost them (and big).
Unlike for regular medical insurance, they have the right to refuse her
for this policy.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m incredibly moved by how kind and helpful our other two children
are. Today, for example, our son took solicitous care of his sister
during lunch: opening the ketchup for her, picking up things that fell,
making sure she had her vitamins. I let him know how proud of him I am.
He is such a wonderful person.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="take-no-prisoners">Take No Prisoners</h2>
<p>21 Apr 2007</p>
<p>I had a brief talk with my daughter this morning about the severity
of her situation.</p>
<p>Me: You know, this thing you have—</p>
<p>Her: Cancer.</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, your brain tumor. It’s very serious.</p>
<p>Her: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Me: Most people don’t survive it.</p>
<p>Her: Really? [Eyes wide.] Well, I’m going to survive it.</p>
<p>Me: So I just want to make sure you know that even though they
recommend this heavy-duty chemotherapy, they aren’t saying it will
definitely cure you.</p>
<p>Her: Oh, yeah, I know. [Nods vigorously.]</p>
<p>Me: But you still want to do it.</p>
<p>Her: Yes. Definitely.</p>
<p>Me: Okay. And I remember what you said when we left the hospital:
don’t let you quit even if you say you want to. We won’t let you
quit.</p>
<p>Her: Good. I don’t want you to let me quit. Definitely do not let me
quit.</p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="dandelions">Dandelions</h2>
<p>21 Apr 2007</p>
<p>My daughter’s crazy about dandelions in the white puffy stage, the
ones you can blow into the wind. On every walk we stop and pick a few
for her to blow. Her brother and sister have gotten into the game,
dashing here and there and running back with bouquets of them. Here we
are on our way to the store this afternoon:</p>
<p><img src="dandelions-1.jpg" alt="dandelions 1" /> <img
src="dandelions-2.jpg" alt="dandelions 2" /></p>
<h2 class="has-subtitle" id="were-off-to-see-the-wizard">We’re Off to
See the Wizard</h2>
<p>22 Apr 2007</p>
<p>We leave for the hospital and the first round of chemotherapy
tomorrow morning. We’ll be there at least one night, possibly two.
Internet access at the hospital is sketchy, so I won’t be posting again
until we get back home.</p>
